     * <b>When to Specify HealthCheckId</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Specifying a value for <code>HealthCheckId</code> is useful only when
     * Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond
     * to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the
     * status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
     * the following configurations:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You're checking the health of a
     * group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing
     * policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
     * www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
     * all the resource record sets.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53
     * includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
     * with.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource
     * record set.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is
     * unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group
     * healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Alias resource record sets</b>: You specify the following settings:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for an alias resource
     * record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing
     * policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
     * www.example.com with a type of A).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a
     * non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias
     * resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the
     * records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS
     * queries using the alias resource record set.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of
     * non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name,
     * and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the
     * resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
     * </p>
     * </note></li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Geolocation Routing</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic
     * region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in
     * the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a
     * resource record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code>
     * is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for
     * the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy
     * resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
     * record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The United States
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * North America
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The default resource record set
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we
     * recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For
     * example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is
     * serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the
     * server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of
     * the resource record sets (<code>www.example.com</code>).
     * </p>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Create a health check that has the same value for
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a resource record
     * set.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Associate that health check with the resource record set.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>

     * <b>When to Specify HealthCheckId</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Specifying a value for <code>HealthCheckId</code> is useful only when
     * Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond
     * to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the
     * status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
     * the following configurations:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You're checking the health of a
     * group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing
     * policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
     * www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
     * all the resource record sets.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53
     * includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
     * with.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource
     * record set.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is
     * unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group
     * healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Alias resource record sets</b>: You specify the following settings:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for an alias resource
     * record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing
     * policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
     * www.example.com with a type of A).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a
     * non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias
     * resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the
     * records that it responds to DNS queries with.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS
     * queries using the alias resource record set.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of
     * non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name,
     * and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the
     * resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.
     * </p>
     * </note></li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Geolocation Routing</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic
     * region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in
     * the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a
     * resource record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code>
     * is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for
     * the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy
     * resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource
     * record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The United States
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * North America
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The default resource record set
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we
     * recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For
     * example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is
     * serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the
     * server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of
     * the resource record sets (<code>www.example.com</code>).
     * </p>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Create a health check that has the same value for
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a resource record
     * set.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Associate that health check with the resource record set.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </important>

     *         <p>
     *         For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is
     *         unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the
     *         larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
     *         have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for
     *         the entire United States, for North America, and a resource
     *         record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code>
     *         is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the
     *         endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
     *         checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order
     *         until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is
     *         healthy:
     *         </p>
     *         <ul>
     *         <li>
     *         <p>
     *         The United States

     *         <li>

     *         <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b>
     *         </p>
     *         <p>
     *         If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name,
     *         we recommend that you create a separate health check for each
     *         endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
     *         <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for
     *         <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of
     *         <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of
     *         the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not
     *         the name of the resource record sets (
     *         <code>www.example.com</code>).
     *         </p>
     *         <important>
     *         <p>
     *         Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the
     *         following:
     *         </p>
     *         <ul>
     *         <li>
     *         <p>

     * Specifying a value for <code>HealthCheckId</code> is useful only when
     * Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond
     * to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the

     * all the resource record sets.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53
     * includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource
     * record set.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is
     * unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group

     * <p>
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic
     * region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in

     * resource record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code>
     * is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for

     *            <p>
     *            For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is
     *            unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the
     *            larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
     *            have resource record sets for a state in the United States,
     *            for the entire United States, for North America, and a
     *            resource record set that has <code>*</code> for
     *            <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which applies to
     *            all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record
     *            set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record
     *            sets in the following order until it finds a resource record
     *            set for which the endpoint is healthy:

     *            If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain
     *            name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for

     *            <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for
     *            <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of
     *            <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name
     *            of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>
     *            ), not the name of the resource record sets (
     *            <code>www.example.com</code>).

     * Specifying a value for <code>HealthCheckId</code> is useful only when
     * Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond
     * to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the
     * status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in
     * the following configurations:

     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You're checking the health of a

     * policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
     * www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for
     * all the resource record sets.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53
     * includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries
     * with.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource
     * record set.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is
     * unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group
     * healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias

     * queries using the alias resource record set.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of
     * non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name,

     * <p>
     * For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route
     * 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic
     * region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in

     *            <p>
     *            The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a
     *            <i>group</i> of non-alias resource record sets that have the

     *            <b>Geolocation Routing</b>
     *            </p>
     *            <p>
     *            For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is
     *            unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the
     *            larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you
     *            have resource record sets for a state in the United States,
     *            for the entire United States, for North America, and a
     *            resource record set that has <code>*</code> for
     *            <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which applies to
     *            all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record
     *            set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record
     *            sets in the following order until it finds a resource record
     *            set for which the endpoint is healthy:
     *            </p>
     *            <ul>
     *            <li>
     *            <p>
     *            The United States
     *            </p>
     *            </li>
     *            <li>
     *            <p>
     *            North America
     *            </p>
     *            </li>
     *            <li>
     *            <p>
     *            The default resource record set

     *            <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b>
     *            </p>
     *            <p>
     *            If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain
     *            name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for
     *            each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each
     *            <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for
     *            <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of
     *            <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name
     *            of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>
     *            ), not the name of the resource record sets (
     *            <code>www.example.com</code>).
     *            </p>
     *            <important>
     *            <p>
     *            Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the
     *            following:
     *            </p>
     *            <ul>
     *            <li>
     *            <p>
     *            Create a health check that has the same value for
     *            <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a
     *            resource record set.
