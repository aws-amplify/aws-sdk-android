/**
 * <p>
 * Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation
 * creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a
 * different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can create
 * multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region.
 * To create a multi-Region primary key, use the <a>CreateKey</a> operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets
 * you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services
 * Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other
 * metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web
 * Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region
 * without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more
 * information about multi-Region keys, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html"
 * >Multi-Region keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <i>replica key</i> is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used
 * independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its
 * replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the
 * same <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id"
 * >key ID</a> and key material. They also have the same <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec"
 * >key spec</a>, <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage"
 * >key usage</a>, <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin"
 * >key material origin</a>, and <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html"
 * >automatic key rotation status</a>. KMS automatically synchronizes these
 * shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a
 * replica key can differ, including its <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html">key
 * policy</a>, <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html"
 * >tags</a>, <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html"
 * >aliases</a>, and <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html"
 * >Key states of KMS keys</a>. KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to
 * each primary key and replica key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state
 * of <code>Creating</code>. This key state changes to <code>Enabled</code> (or
 * <code>PendingImport</code>) after a few seconds when the process of creating
 * the new replica key is complete. While the key state is <code>Creating</code>
 * , you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations.
 * If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on
 * <code>KMSInvalidStateException</code> or call <code>DescribeKey</code> to
 * check its <code>KeyState</code> value before using it. For details about the
 * <code>Creating</code> key state, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html"
 * >Key states of KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any Region. If
 * the Region already includes a replica of the key you're trying to replicate,
 * <code>ReplicateKey</code> returns an <code>AlreadyExistsException</code>
 * error. If the key state of the existing replica is
 * <code>PendingDeletion</code>, you can cancel the scheduled key deletion
 * (<a>CancelKeyDeletion</a>) or wait for the key to be deleted. The new replica
 * key you create will have the same <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-sync-properties"
 * >shared properties</a> as the original replica key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CloudTrail log of a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation records a
 * <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation in the primary key's Region and a
 * <a>CreateKey</a> operation in the replica key's Region.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the
 * replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key
 * material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html"
 * >Importing key material into multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management
 * Service Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the <a>UpdatePrimaryRegion</a>
 * operation.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * <code>ReplicateKey</code> uses different default values for the
 * <code>KeyPolicy</code> and <code>Tags</code> parameters than those used in
 * the KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot use this operation to create a
 * replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Required permissions</b>:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>kms:ReplicateKey</code> on the primary key (in the primary key's
 * Region). Include this permission in the primary key's key policy.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>kms:CreateKey</code> in an IAM policy in the replica Region.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>

     *            The key policy to attach to the KMS key. This parameter is
     *            optional. If you do not provide a key policy, KMS attaches the
     *            <a href=
     *            "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default"

     *            </p>
     *            <p>
     *            The key policy is not a shared property of multi-Region keys.
     *            You can specify the same key policy or a different key policy
     *            for each key in a set of related multi-Region keys. KMS does
     *            not synchronize this property.
     *            </p>
     *            <p>
     *            If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following
     *            criteria:
     *            </p>
     *            <ul>
     *            <li>
     *            <p>
     *            The key policy must allow the calling principal to make a
     *            subsequent <code>PutKeyPolicy</code> request on the KMS key.
     *            This reduces the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable.
     *            For more information, see <a href=
     *            "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html#prevent-unmanageable-key"
     *            >Default key policy</a> in the <i>Key Management Service
     *            Developer Guide</i>. (To omit this condition, set
     *            <code>BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck</code> to true.)
     *            </p>
     *            </li>
     *            <li>
     *            <p>
     *            Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
     *            principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
     *            visible to KMS. When you create a new Amazon Web Services
     *            principal, you might need to enforce a delay before including
     *            the new principal in a key policy because the new principal
     *            might not be immediately visible to KMS. For more information,

     *            Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this
     *            parameter to tag the KMS key when it is created. To tag an
     *            existing KMS key, use the <a>TagResource</a> operation.

     *            Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to
     *            the KMS key. For details, see <a href=
     *            "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html"

     *            >kms:TagResource</a> permission in an IAM policy.

     *            <p>
     *            Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can
     *            specify the same tags or different tags for each key in a set
     *            of related multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this
     *            property.
     *            </p>
     *            <p>
     *            Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag
     *            key and the tag value are required, but the tag value can be
     *            an empty (null) string. You cannot have more than one tag on a
     *            KMS key with the same tag key. If you specify an existing tag
     *            key with a different tag value, KMS replaces the current tag
     *            value with the specified one.
     *            </p>
     *            <p>
     *            When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon
     *            Web Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and
     *            costs aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control
     *            access to a KMS key. For details, see <a href=
     *            "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html"
