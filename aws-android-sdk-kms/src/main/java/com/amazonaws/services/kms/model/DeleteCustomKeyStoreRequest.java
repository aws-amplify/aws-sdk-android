/**
 * <p>
 * Deletes a <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html"
 * >custom key store</a>. This operation does not delete the AWS CloudHSM
 * cluster that is associated with the custom key store, or affect any users or
 * keys in the cluster.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys"
 * >customer master keys (CMKs)</a>. Before deleting the key store, verify that
 * you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any
 * cryptographic operations. Then, use <a>ScheduleKeyDeletion</a> to delete the
 * AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled
 * waiting period expires, the <code>ScheduleKeyDeletion</code> operation
 * deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from
 * the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key"
 * >delete the orphaned key material</a> from the cluster and its backups.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a>
 * to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key
 * store.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using
 * <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key
 * store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store.
 * But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected
 * custom key store at any time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation is part of the <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html"
 * >Custom Key Store feature</a> feature in AWS KMS, which combines the
 * convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and
 * control of a single-tenant key store.
