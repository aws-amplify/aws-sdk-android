     *            If you provide a key policy, it must meet the following

     *            <ul>
     *            <li>

     *            If you don't set <code>BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck</code>
     *            to true, the key policy must allow the principal that is
     *            making the <code>CreateKey</code> request to make a subsequent
     *            <a>PutKeyPolicy</a> request on the CMK. This reduces the risk
     *            that the CMK becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer

     *            Each statement in the key policy must contain one or more
     *            principals. The principals in the key policy must exist and be
     *            visible to AWS KMS. When you create a new AWS principal (for
     *            example, an IAM user or role), you might need to enforce a
     *            delay before including the new principal in a key policy
     *            because the new principal might not be immediately visible to
