/**
 * <p>
 * Connects or reconnects a <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html"
 * >custom key store</a> to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master
 * keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect
 * and reconnect a custom key store at any time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have
 * at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use
 * the <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html"
 * >DescribeClusters</a> operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html"
 * >CreateHsm</a> operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to
 * 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not
 * wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an
 * HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this
 * response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the
 * connection state of the custom key store, use the
 * <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is
 * associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure,
 * connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser"
 * > <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user</a> (CU), and rotates its password.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> operation might fail for various
 * reasons. To find the reason, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation
 * and see the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code> in the response. For help
 * interpreting the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code>, see
 * <a>CustomKeyStoresListEntry</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To fix the failure, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to
 * disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the
 * <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> operation if necessary, and then use
 * <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see
 * <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html"
 * >Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service
 * Developer Guide</i>.
