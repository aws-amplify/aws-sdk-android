/**
 * <p>
 * Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream. The URL can then
 * be opened in a browser or media player to view the stream contents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You must specify either the <code>StreamName</code> or the
 * <code>StreamARN</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for providing
 * data through HLS:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The media type must be <code>video/h264</code>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Data retention must be greater than 0.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The fragments must contain codec private data in the AVC (Advanced Video
 * Coding) for H.264 format (<a
 * href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html">MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC
 * 14496-15</a>). For information about adapting stream data to a given format,
 * see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html"
 * >NAL Adaptation Flags</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented MPEG-4
 * form (also called fMP4 or CMAF), rather than the MPEG-2 form (also called TS
 * chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more information
 * about HLS fragment types, see the <a
 * href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23">HLS
 * specification</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Get an endpoint using <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html"
 * >GetDataEndpoint</a>, specifying <code>GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL</code>
 * for the <code>APIName</code> parameter.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Retrieve the HLS URL using <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code>. Kinesis
 * Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for accessing
 * content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
 * <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code> returns an authenticated URL (that
 * includes an encrypted session token) for the session's HLS <i>master
 * playlist</i> (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access it.
 * The token provides access to the content of the stream. Safeguard the token
 * with the same measures that you would use with your AWS credentials.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * The media that is made available through the playlist consists only of the
 * requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data (such as frames
 * outside the requested window or alternate bit rates) is made available.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS master
 * playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol. Kinesis Video
 * Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization fragment, and media
 * fragments available through the master playlist URL. The initialization
 * fragment contains the codec private data for the stream, and other data
 * needed to set up the video decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain
 * H.264-encoded video frames and time stamps.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream metadata
 * and media data normally. When the media player requests data, it calls the
 * following actions:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>GetHLSMasterPlaylist:</b> Retrieves an HLS master playlist, which contains
 * a URL for the <code>GetHLSMediaPlaylist</code> action, and additional
 * metadata for the media player, including estimated bit rate and resolution.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>GetHLSMediaPlaylist:</b> Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which contains a
 * URL to access the MP4 intitialization fragment with the
 * <code>GetMP4InitFragment</code> action, and URLs to access the MP4 media
 * fragments with the <code>GetMP4MediaFragment</code> actions. The HLS media
 * playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the player needs to
 * play it, such as whether the <code>PlaybackMode</code> is <code>LIVE</code>
 * or <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is typically static for
 * sessions with a <code>PlaybackType</code> of <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS
 * media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for sessions with a
 * <code>PlaybackType</code> of <code>LIVE</code>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>GetMP4InitFragment:</b> Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The
 * media player typically loads the initialization fragment before loading any
 * media fragments. This fragment contains the "<code>fytp</code>" and "
 * <code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to
 * initialize the media player decoder.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis
 * video stream. It contains only the codec private data for the stream, which
 * the media player needs to decode video frames.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>GetMP4MediaFragment:</b> Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments
 * contain the "<code>moof</code>" and "<code>mdat</code>" MP4 atoms and their
 * child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's video frames and their time
 * stamps.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session, any
 * fragments that don't contain the same codec private data are excluded in the
 * HLS media playlist. Therefore, the codec private data does not change between
 * fragments in a session.
 * </p>
 * </note></li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The service
 * might throttle a session if multiple media players are sharing it. For
 * connection limits, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html"
 * >Kinesis Video Streams Limits</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of five active HLS streaming
 * sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum number of sessions is
 * already active, the oldest (earliest created) session is closed. The number
 * of active <code>GetMedia</code> connections on a Kinesis video stream does
 * not count against this limit, and the number of active HLS sessions does not
 * count against the active <code>GetMedia</code> connection limit.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
 * monitoring the <code>GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes</code> Amazon
 * CloudWatch metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis
 * Video Streams, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html"
 * >Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams</a>. For pricing information, see <a
 * href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/">Amazon Kinesis
 * Video Streams Pricing</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/">AWS
 * Pricing</a>. Charges for both HLS sessions and outgoing AWS data apply.
