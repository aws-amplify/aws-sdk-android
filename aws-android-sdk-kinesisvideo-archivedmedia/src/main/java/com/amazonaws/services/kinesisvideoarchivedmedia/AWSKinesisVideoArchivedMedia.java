     * then be opened in a browser or media player to view the stream contents.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You must specify either the <code>StreamName</code> or the
     * <code>StreamARN</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
     * providing data through HLS:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The media type must be <code>video/h264</code>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Data retention must be greater than 0.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The fragments must contain codec private data in the AVC (Advanced Video
     * Coding) for H.264 format (<a
     * href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html">MPEG-4 specification
     * ISO/IEC 14496-15</a>). For information about adapting stream data to a
     * given format, see <a href=
     * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html"
     * >NAL Adaptation Flags</a>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented
     * MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF), rather than the MPEG-2 form (also
     * called TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more
     * information about HLS fragment types, see the <a
     * href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23"
     * >HLS specification</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
     * </p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Get an endpoint using <a href=
     * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html"
     * >GetDataEndpoint</a>, specifying
     * <code>GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL</code> for the <code>APIName</code>
     * parameter.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Retrieve the HLS URL using <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code>.
     * Kinesis Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for
     * accessing content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
     * <code>GetHLSStreamingSessionURL</code> returns an authenticated URL (that
     * includes an encrypted session token) for the session's HLS <i>master
     * playlist</i> (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could access
     * it. The token provides access to the content of the stream. Safeguard the
     * token with the same measures that you would use with your AWS
     * credentials.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * The media that is made available through the playlist consists only of
     * the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data (such
     * as frames outside the requested window or alternate bit rates) is made
     * available.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS
     * master playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol. Kinesis
     * Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization fragment, and
     * media fragments available through the master playlist URL. The
     * initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the stream,
     * and other data needed to set up the video decoder and renderer. The media
     * fragments contain H.264-encoded video frames and time stamps.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
     * metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests data, it
     * calls the following actions:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetHLSMasterPlaylist:</b> Retrieves an HLS master playlist, which
     * contains a URL for the <code>GetHLSMediaPlaylist</code> action, and
     * additional metadata for the media player, including estimated bit rate
     * and resolution.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetHLSMediaPlaylist:</b> Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
     * contains a URL to access the MP4 intitialization fragment with the
     * <code>GetMP4InitFragment</code> action, and URLs to access the MP4 media
     * fragments with the <code>GetMP4MediaFragment</code> actions. The HLS
     * media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the player
     * needs to play it, such as whether the <code>PlaybackMode</code> is
     * <code>LIVE</code> or <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is
     * typically static for sessions with a <code>PlaybackType</code> of
     * <code>ON_DEMAND</code>. The HLS media playlist is continually updated
     * with new fragments for sessions with a <code>PlaybackType</code> of
     * <code>LIVE</code>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetMP4InitFragment:</b> Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The
     * media player typically loads the initialization fragment before loading
     * any media fragments. This fragment contains the "<code>fytp</code>" and "
     * <code>moov</code>" MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to
     * initialize the media player decoder.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in a
     * Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data for the
     * stream, which the media player needs to decode video frames.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>GetMP4MediaFragment:</b> Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
     * fragments contain the "<code>moof</code>" and "<code>mdat</code>" MP4
     * atoms and their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment's video
     * frames and their time stamps.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming session,
     * any fragments that don't contain the same codec private data are excluded
     * in the HLS media playlist. Therefore, the codec private data does not
     * change between fragments in a session.
     * </p>
     * </note></li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * The following restrictions apply to HLS sessions:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * A streaming session URL should not be shared between players. The service
     * might throttle a session if multiple media players are sharing it. For
     * connection limits, see <a href=
     * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html"
     * >Kinesis Video Streams Limits</a>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * A Kinesis video stream can have a maximum of five active HLS streaming
     * sessions. If a new session is created when the maximum number of sessions
     * is already active, the oldest (earliest created) session is closed. The
     * number of active <code>GetMedia</code> connections on a Kinesis video
     * stream does not count against this limit, and the number of active HLS
     * sessions does not count against the active <code>GetMedia</code>
     * connection limit.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
     * monitoring the <code>GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes</code> Amazon
     * CloudWatch metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor
     * Kinesis Video Streams, see <a href=
     * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html"
