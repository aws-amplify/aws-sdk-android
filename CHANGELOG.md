## [Release 2.18.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.18.0)

*Version 2.18.0 introduces breaking changes against 2.17.1.*

### Breaking Updates
- aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:
   - No breaking changes code-wise but if you already setup HostedUI for an older version of the SDK,  
   you'll need to follow the steps in the [updated documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/sdk/auth/hosted-ui/q/platform/android#setup-amazon-cognito-hosted-ui-in-android-app)
   to properly handle the response going forward.
- aws-android-sdk-cognitoauth:
   - `getSession()` method has been refactored to `getSession(Activity activity)`, where `activity` is an instance of 
   the activity the user is calling this method from. It uses this to launch HostedUI if it needs to sign in again.
   - `getSession(boolean launchWebUIIfExpired)` has been refactored to `getSessionWithoutWebUI()`. It will get session 
   information if the refresh token is still valid, otherwise will throw an exception indicating the user must sign in 
   again.
   
### Bug Fixes
- aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:
    - `getTokens()` was making a network call every time it was used, negating any benefit of cached tokens. Removed 
    the unnecessary network call so it now correctly returns cached tokens when available with no network call (Issue #1722)

## [Release 2.17.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.17.1)

### Bug Fixes

- **Amazon Pinpoint**
  - Fixed a bug where setting `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` and `Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP` on the `notificationIntent` being created for displaying notification causes a crash in Android OS Versions < 4.4. The fix involves removing the setting of flags as it is not relavent for an intent that communicates with a Android Service and a Broadcast receiver.

### Misc. Updates

- Model updates for the following services
  - Amazon Connect

### Bug Fixes

- **AWS Core**
  - Added warning against using `BasicAWSCredentials` instead of `AWSMobileClient` in Javadoc.

- **AWS Mobile Client**
  - During `signUp`, when the user is confirmed, Cognito does not send `CognitoUserCodeDeliveryDetails`
and it appears to be null when the SignUpResult is unmarshalled. Add a check before accessing the `CognitoUserCodeDeliveryDetails` only when the user is not confirmed. See [issue #1264](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1264) for more details.

## [Release 2.16.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.16.2)

### New Features

- **AWS Core**
  - Now supports calling LogFactory.setLevel(Level) to set a global level of which logs will be output. Any logs below the set level will not be output
    You can also call Log.setLevel(Level) on a specific Logger to limit the logs which are output by a specific class. Addresses issue #1174

- **Amazon Polly**
  - `SynthesizeSpeechPresignRequest` now supports the ability to specify the engine (`standard` or neural) for a request.

### Bug Fixes

- **AWSMobileClient**
  - Sets default confirmSignup behavior to prevent a user from signing up with the same email/phone as another user. This is the same as iOS.
    NOTE: When you upgrade to this version, your app behavior will change from allowing users to sign up with the same email/phone as another user
    (and just overriding the existing user) to giving the user an error if they attempt to do that.

- **AWS IoT**
  - Specified minimum SDK (11) and target SDK (27) version in `AndroidManifest.xml` for IoT SDK.
  - Prevents unintended permission from being implied in `AndroidManifest.xml`. See [Issue #1234](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1234).

### Misc. Updates

- **Amazon S3**
  - Added serialized name annotation to `TransferNetworkConnectionType` enum values and added instrumentation tests.

    - `SignUpResult` available in the user callback provided during sign up now contains UserSub(UID)
    - Deprecated APIs `getCredentialsProvider`, `setCredentialsProvider`, `initialize(Context)` and `initialize(Context, AWSStartupHandler)` have been removed
    - `confirmSignIn(final Map<String, String> signInChallengeResponse)` now throws `IllegalStateException` if `confirmSignIn` is called after signIn has succeeded. This matches the behavior of the overloaded version of this method, viz. `confirmSignIn(final String signInChallengeResponse, final Callback<SignInResult> callback)`
  - AWSMobileClient now supports Cognito Custom Authentication flow. See relevant [cognito docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html#amazon-cognito-user-pools-custom-authentication-flow) and [amplify docs](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/android/authentication#customizing-authentication-flow) for details

- **Amazon CognitoIdentityProvider**
  - **Breaking API Change** `SignUpHandler` now receives `SignUpResult` upon success instead of a ConfirmationState and `CognitoUserCodeDeliveryDetails`
  - `signUpInBackground` and `signUp` now receive `SignUpResult` in the `onSuccess` callback

- **Amazon SNS**
  - Updated model to support latest Amazon SNS features such as `TagResource` function. This resolves [Issue# 1020](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1020).

### Misc. Updates

- Model updates for the following services
  - Amazon SES
  - Amazon SNS
  - Amazon Textract
  - Amazon Transcribe

## [Release 2.15.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.15.2)

### Bug Fixes
- **AWS Mobile Client**
  - Fix issue where MobileClient would return invalid tokens after initialization when using Hosted UI.
    See [issue #873](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/873) and
    [issue #888](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/888)
- **Amazon Cognito Identity Provider**
  - Use internal username for computing secret hash that is passed in challenge response. See [Issue# 889](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/889) for details

### Misc. Updates

- Model updates for the following services
  - Amazon Connect
  - Amazon Rekognition
  - Amazon Transcribe

## [Release 2.15.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.15.1)

### Bug Fixes

- **AWS Core Runtime**
  - Fixed a bug where encrypted authentication data persisted by the SDK could not be recovered due to:
      * The encryption key being removed
      * The encryption key being replaced
      * The encryption key not being recoverable by the OS

    These conditions formerly resulted in an app crash. Now, the errors are logged (without logging sensitive data) and the decryption attempt returns `null`, as if the data simply isn't present in the persistent store.

    Classes affected:
    - `CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider`
    - `CognitoUserPool`
    - `CognitoAuth`
    - `AWSMobileClient`

    For more detail, see issues:
    - [#937](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/937)
    - [#1108](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1108)
    - [#1109](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1109)
    - [#1115](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1115)

- **Amazon S3**
  - Fixed a bug where multi-part uploads via `TransferUtility` would fail to propagate tags to `Amazon S3` from the `UserMetadata` passed through the `ObjectMetadata`. See [Issue#541](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/541).
  - The following code should now attach a tag for both single-part and multi-part uploads:

	```java
	ObjectMetadata metadata = new ObjectMetadata();
	metadata.addUserMetadata(Headers.S3_TAGGING, "key=value");
	TransferObserver observer = transferUtility.upload(
		file.getName(),
		file,
		metadata
	);
	```

## [Release 2.15.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.15.0)

### Bug Fixes

- **AWS Core Runtime**
  - Update `LogFactory.getLog` to automatically truncate the log tag to be within 23 character limit imposed by Android for Nougat(7.0) releases and prior(API <= 23). See [issue #1103](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1103)
- **Amazon Pinpoint**
  - Removed the check for INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions while initializing `PinpointManager`. These are [normal permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#normal_permissions) and therefore are not required to be checked before performing corresponding app-op. This changes Pinpoint SDK behavior to match that of our other SDKs where an `UnknownHostException` or a corresponding RuntimeException would be thrown if connectivity is not present when network calls are made by the SDK. This fixes [Issue#1092](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/1092).

### Misc. Updates

- **Breaking Changes**
  - Removed deprecated SDKGlobalConfiguration options:
    - `ENABLE_S3_SIGV4_SYSTEM_PROPERTY`
    - `ENFORCE_S3_SIGV4_SYSTEM_PROPERTY`
- Remove unused `mfaOption` property from `CognitoUserAttributes` class

* **Amazon S3**
  * Fixed a bug where uploading a file using `AmazonS3Client.putObject(PutObjectRequest)` with `SSEAwsKeyManagementParams` fails with contentMD5 validation error. Now, the contentMd5 validation is skipped when a file is uploaded with `SSEAwsKeyManagementParams` through the `PutObjectRequest`.

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
  * Added `SocketException` to the list of client exceptions where the events submitted to Amazon Pinpoint will be saved in the local database. See [issue #773](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/773).

## [Release 2.13.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.13.1)

### Enhancements

* **AWS Mobile Client**
  * Updated Google or Facebook refresh when using the drop-in UI. See [issue #809](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/809), [issue #700](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/700).

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon S3**
  * Fixed an issue where the transfer state is not set to `WAITING_FOR_NETWORK` when the network disconnects. See [issue #616](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/616)
  * Shorten `RepeatableFileInputStream` log tag to be within the 23 character limit imposed by android on certain API Levels. See [issue #787](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/787)

* **AWS Mobile Client**
  * Fixed a bug that caused repetitive sign-in using the drop-in UI to the same provider to not federate the correct credentials. See [issue #809](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/809)

* **Amazon Cognito Auth**
  * Fixed a bug that caused `isAuthenticated()` to return false after sign-in when no scopes were requested. See [issue #813](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/813)

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
  * Fix a bug where the image that is part of a push notification is persisted in the subsequent notifications.
  * Fix a bug where the events recorded and stored in the device will not be deleted when the network is not available. See [issue #773](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/773). With this change, the events will be kept in the local database when there is a retryable error or device is offline. For all other exceptions during `submitEvents`, the exception is logged and the events will be removed from the local database.

## [Release 2.13.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.13.0)

### Enhancements

* **AWS IoT**
  * AWS IoT SDK for Android now supports MQTT over TLS with X.509 client certificate authentication on port 443. Previously this combination of protocol and authentication mechanism was only supported on port 8883. `connectUsingALPN()` method allows developers to connect to AWS IoT using client certificate authentication on port 443. Please look at [this blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/mqtt-with-tls-client-authentication-on-port-443-why-it-is-useful-and-how-it-works/) for more details.
  * **Breaking Change:** Please note that the type of aws-android-sdk-iot artifact is being changed from a`jar` to an `aar`. Also note that the `aar` artifacts needs to be explicitly specified in the dependency as `implementation ("com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-iot:2.12.+@aar") { transitive =true }` on some of the older versions of gradle.

### Bug Fixes

* **AWS Mobile Client**
  * Fixed a bug when initializing drop-in UI that caused the Facebook, Google, or Userpools provider to not be instantiated.

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services

  * Added support for developer authenticated identities in `federatedSignIn()`. See [issue #577](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/577)
  * Added support Cognito Hosted UI in `showSignIn()`.
  * Added support to use OAuth 2.0 provider like `Auth0` in `showSignIn()`. Federation for AWS credentials requires OpenID support from the provider.
  * Added support for global sign out.
  * Added support for device features which include `list`, `get`, `updateStatus` and `forget`. These APIs are available through `getDeviceOperations()`.

* **Amazon Cognito Identity Provider**

* **AWS Core**
  * Fixed a crash in initializing `CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider` while migrating the data stored under `expirationDate`.

## [Release 2.12.3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.12.3)

### Enhancements

* **AWS Core**
  * Persistence of client state including user credentials is now enabled and encrypted by default.
  * Added a method `CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider.setPersistenceEnabled(boolean)`, which is enabled (set to true) by default therefore the information is persisted in SharedPreferences. When disabled (set to false), the information will only be kept in memory.

* **Amazon CognitoIdentityProvider**
  * Persistence of client state including user credentials is now enabled and encrypted by default.
  * Added a method `CognitoUserPool.setPersistenceEnabled(boolean)`, which is enabled (set to true) by default therefore the information is persisted in SharedPreferences. When disabled (set to false), the information will only be kept in memory.

* **Amazon CognitoAuth**
  * Persistence of client state including user credentials is now enabled and encrypted by default.
  * Added a method `Auth.setPersistenceEnabled(boolean)`, which is enabled (set to true) by default therefore the information is persisted in SharedPreferences. When disabled (set to false), the information will only be kept in memory.

* **AWSMobileClient**
  * Persistence of client state including user credentials is now enabled and encrypted by default.
  * Added an option through `awsconfiguration.json` to disable persistence. **Note:** The Amplify CLI (as of March 8th 2019) does not support this configuration and will remove it when auto-generating the `awsconfiguration.json`.
    ```
    {
      "Auth": {
        "Default": {
          "Persistence": false
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## [Release 2.12.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.12.2)

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services
  * Amazon S3

## [Release 2.12.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.12.1)

### Bug Fixes

* **AWS Mobile Client**
  * Fixed a bug that cause `changePassword(String, String, Callback)` to return error when successful. The error returned was null and will now call `onResult(Void)`

### Enhancements

* **Amazon Cognito Identity Provider**
  * The Amazon Cognito Identity Provider SDK now supports all Amazon Cognito Identity Provider APIs, including "CreateUserPool", "DescribeUserPool", "UpdateUserPool", "ListUserPools", "AdminEnableUser", "AdminDisableUser", "AdminConfirmRegisterUser", "AdminResetUserPassword", "AdminGetUser", "AdminUpdateUserAttributes", "AdminDeleteUserAttributes", "AdminDeleteUser". All admin APIs require developer credentials. Note that by using admin APIs, you are inherently dealing with privileged functions that could result in data loss, if improperly used.
  * Fixed `initiateUserAuthentication()` to respect `runInBackground` flag for network calls. See [pr #702](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/702)

* **AWS Core Runtime**
  * Add templated callback structure for async methods across SDKs. Internal `ReturningRunnable` added to facilitate support for synchronous and asynchronous methods.

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services
  * AWS IoT
  * Amazon Lambda

## [Release 2.12.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.12.0)

### Enhancements

* **Amazon Cognito Auth**
  * Allow user to unbind the service after being done with authentication. See [pr #615](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/615). Thanks @rlatapy-luna!

* **Amazon Cognito User Pools**
  * Adds support for the SRP protocol at the beginning of custom auth. Please use `AuthenticationDetails(String, String, Map<String, String>, Map<String, String>)` to trigger custom auth flow with SRP protocol as the first step.

* **Amazon S3**
    * **Note:** AWS Signature Version 4 (`SigV4`) is recommended for signing Amazon S3 API requests over AWS Signature Version 2 (`SigV2`) as it provides improved security by using a signing key rather than your secret access key. SigV4 is currently supported in all AWS regions while SigV2 is only supported in regions launched prior to Jan 2014. Amazon S3 will stop accepting requests signed using SigV2 in all regions on June 24, 2019, any
requests signed using SigV2 made after this time will fail. Please visit the S3 documentation site to get more information on using SigV4: [Signing Aamzon S3 requests using SigV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html). You can find the list of
changes between versions here: [Changes in SigV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_changes.html).
   * Deprecated the existing constructors in `AmazonS3Client` and introduced equivalent constructors that require the AWS region, because a valid AWS region is required to sign the request using SigV4. Please use the following constructors to specify the AWS region in order to sign the request to Amazon S3 using SigV4.

2.11.1 | 2.12.0
---------- | -------------
AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentials) | AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentials, com.amazonaws.regions.Region)
AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentials, ClientConfiguration) | AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentials, ClientConfiguration, com.amazonaws.regions.Region)
AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentialsProvider) | AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentialsProvider, com.amazonaws.regions.Region)
AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentialsProvider, ClientConfiguration) | AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentialsProvider, ClientConfiguration, com.amazonaws.regions.Region)
AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentialsProvider, ClientConfiguration, HttpClient) | AmazonS3Client(AWSCredentialsProvider, ClientConfiguration, HttpClient, com.amazonaws.regions.Region)
AmazonS3Client(ClientConfiguration) | AmazonS3Client(ClientConfiguration, com.amazonaws.regions.Region)

## [Release 2.11.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.11.1)

### New Features

* **Amazon S3**
  * Add the ability to specify the type of network connection (`TransferNetworkConnectionType.ANY` - any network, `TransferNetworkConnectionType.MOBILE` - mobile only, `TransferNetworkConnectionType.WIFI` - WiFi only) for the transfers through `TransferUtilityOptions`. The `TransferUtilityOptions` is passed to the `TransferUtility` object and is used for all the transfers that are initiated through this object. The network connection type can be passed while constructing the `TransferUtilityOptions` object through `TransferUtilityOptions(int, TransferNetworkConnectionType)`. See [pr #575](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/575). Thanks @nasdf!

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon Cognito Identity Provider**
  * Fixed a bug that used a null username during custom auth challenge. See [issue #657](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/657) & [issue #583](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/583)

* **AWS IoT**
  - Fixed a bug that caused some IoT connections to not reconnect after errors.
    [See PR #660](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/660).
    Thanks @sklikowicz!

* **Amazon S3**
  * Improved the state, progress and error reporting when the transfers are interrupted.
      * When the transfer is paused or cancelled by the user, the state is reported correctly.
      * When the transfer is interrupted because of a network drop, the state is set to WAITING_FOR_NETWORK when the `TransferNetworkLossHandler` is used.
      * When the transfer is interrupted otherwise, the transfer is set to FAILED and the exception is reported via `TransferListener.onError` callback.
  * Fixed the bug where progress is reported inaccurately (over 100%) when a transfer is paused by user or network drop and resumed before completion. See [issue #677](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/677), [issue #667](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/667), [issue #616](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/616), [issue #406](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/406)

### Enhancements

* **Amazon Cognito Identity**
  - The Amazon Cognito Identity SDK now supports all Amazon Cognito Identity
    APIs, including admin APIs that require developer credentials. Note that by
    using admin APIs, you are inherently dealing with privileged functions that
    could result in data loss of data if improperly used. [See issue
    #645](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/645)

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services
  * AWS IoT
  * Amazon Comprehend
  * Amazon Cognito Identity Provider
  * Amazon Kinesis Firehose
  * Amazon Transcribe
  * Amazon Pinpoint

## [Release 2.11.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.11.0)

### Enhancements

* **Amazon S3**
  * Introduced `TransferNetworkLossHandler`, a utility that listens for network connectivity changes. `TransferNetworkLossHandler` pauses the on-going transfers when the network goes offline and resumes the transfers that were paused when the network comes back online.
  * `TransferService` will be moved to foreground state when the device is running Android Oreo (API Level 26) and above.
      * Transitioning to the foreground state requires a valid on-going `Notification` object, identifier for on-going notification and the flag that determines the ability to remove the on-going notification when the service transitions out of foreground state. If a valid notification object is not passed in, the service will not be transitioned into the foreground state.
      * The `TransferService` can now be started using `startForegroundService` method to move the service to foreground state. The service can be invoked in the following way to transition the service to foreground state: `getApplicationContext().startForegroundService(intent);`.

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon S3**
  * Fixed a bug in `TransferUtility` where the state is not set to '`WAITING_FOR_NETWORK` when network goes offline during execution of transfers.
  * Fixed a bug where objects with key name containing characters that require special handling are uploaded with URL encoded key name on the S3 bucket.
      * Since `2.4.0` version of the SDK, the key name containing characters that require special handling are URL encoded and escaped `( space, %2A, ~, /, :, ', (, ), !, [, ] )` by the `AmazonS3Client`, after which the AWS Android Core Runtime encodes the URL resulting in double encoding of the key name.
      * Starting `2.11.0`, the additional layer of encoding and escaping done by `AmazonS3Client` is removed. The key name will not be encoded and escaped by `AmazonS3Client`. Now, the key name that is given to `AmazonS3Client` or `TransferUtility` will appear on the Amazon S3 console as is.
      * See [issue #526](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/526), [issue #321](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/321), [issue #360](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/360)
, [issue #545](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/545), [issue #597](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/597).
  * Fixed a bug where `AmazonS3Client.listObjects` operation executed on a bucket, with key names containing characters that require special handling, returns the `ListObjectsResponse` with the key names being URL encoded.
      * When a S3 bucket contans objects with key names containing characters that require special handling, and since the SDK has an XML parser,  (XML 1.0 parser) which cannot parse some characters, the SDK is required to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. This can be done by passing in `url` as `encodingType` in the `ListObjectsRequest`.
      * Since `2.4.0`, there was a bug where the SDK did not decode the key names which are encoded by S3 when `url` is requested as the `encodingType`. This is fixed in `2.11.0`, where the SDK will decode the key names in the `ListObjectsResponse` sent by S3.
      * If you have objects in S3 bucket that has a key name containing characters that require special handling, you need to pass the `encodingType` as `url` in the `ListObjectsRequest`.

### Misc. Updates

* **Amazon S3**
  * Allow requester-pays access for `listObjects` and `listObjectsV2` requests.

## [Release 2.10.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.10.1)

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
  * Fixed a bug where `Attributes` were not being sent in the `Event` payload while submitting events to Pinpoint. See [PR #641](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/641)

## [Release 2.10.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.10.0)

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services
    * Amazon Lex
        * Added overrides to various `InteractionClient` and `LexServiceContinuation` methods, to allow passing request attributes
        * **Breaking API Changes:** The following APIs have been changed:
            * `PostContentRequest`, `PostContentResponse`
                * Certain properties which used to have a type of `Map<String, String>` are now `String`. This requires your calling code to
                  JSON serialize and base64-encode the value. The `get`, `set` and `with` APIs of the following properties are affected:
                  - `PostContentRequest.requestAttributes`
                  - `PostContentRequest.sessionAttributes`
                  - `PostContentRequest.slots`
                  - `PostContentResponse.requestAttributes`
                  - `PostContentResponse.sessionAttributes`
                  - `PostContentResponse.slots`

## [Release 2.9.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.9.2)

### Bug Fixes

* **AWS IoT**
  * `AWSIotMqttManager` passes publish exceptions via the callback. If callback is not provided it throws `AmazonClientException`.
  * `AWSIotMqttManager` logs the reconnection errors and pass it to the user provided connection callback.

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
  * Fixed bug that could potentially cause rejected events to be dropped incorrectly because service response could not be unmarshalled. The response will now be processed correctly and events rejected by the service will be retried.

* **Amazon S3**
  * Fixed a bug where a disk operation to remove completed transfers from database was performed on the main thread. See [issue #603](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/603)

  * Fixed reporting of failed message publishes during reconnect. See [PR #407](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/407)
  * Fix reconnection failure upon network disconnect. Any subsequent reconnect honors the value passed to the cleanSession flag. See [issue #584](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/584) and [PR #612](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/pull/612)

* **AWS Mobile Client**
  * Fixed exception being thrown from `getCredentials()` and `refresh()` to adhere to `AmazonClientException` to allow other portions of SDK to catch properly. Previously a generic `RuntimeException` was being thrown; `AmazonClientException` is a subclass of `RuntimeException`. See [issue #588](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues/588)

## [Release 2.9.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.9.0)

### New Features

* **AWS Core Runtime**
  * Added support for EU (Stockholm) region - `eu-north-1`.

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
    * `AppPackageName`, `AppTitle`, `AppVersionCode`, `SdkName` fields will now be accepted as part of the `Event` when submitting events from your app to Amazon Pinpoint. This fixes the issue where the event when exported by Amazon Kinesis Streams was missing these fields in the exported event.

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services
    * Amazon Pinpoint
        * **Breaking API Changes:** The following APIs have been changed:
            * `PutEventsRequest`

      * `range key type does not match that of table definition`

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
  *  Fix an issue where the consecutive direct send messages / send user messages (excluding campaign) replaces the previous notifications. Now the request identifier for the notification is changed from the hashcode of `<campaign_id>:<campaign_activity_id>` to the hashcode of a unique identifier for Direct send messages / send user messages (excluding campaign), so that the notifications are unique within the application. See [AWS Forums Post](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=291743)

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services
  * Amazon Auto Scaling

## [Release 2.8.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.8.0)

### New Features

* **AWS Mobile Client**
  * The `AWSMobileClient` provides client APIs and building blocks for developers who want to create user authentication experiences.  It supports the following new features:
    - User state tracking: `AWSMobileClient` offers on-demand querying for the “login state” of a user in the application.
    - Credentials management: Automatic refreshing of `Cognito User Pools` `JWT Token` and `AWS Credentials` from `Cognito Identity`.
    - Offline support: `AWSMobileClient` is optimized to account for applications transitioning from offline to online connectivity, and refreshing credentials at the appropriate time so that errors do not occur when actions are taken and connectivity is not available.
    - Drop-in Auth UI: `AWSMobileClient` client supports easy “drop-in” UI for your application.
    - Simple, declarative APIs `signUp`, `signIn`, `confirmSignIn`, etc.

> Note: The existing methods of `AWSMobileClient` are deprecated and will be removed in a future minor version. `AWSMobileClient` now takes a dependency on `AWSCognitoIdentityProvider`(Cognito User Pools SDK) package to offer integration with `CognitoUserPools`. When using the new drop-in UI, `AWSAuthUI` and `Social sign-in` features continue to be pluggable dependencies for `AWSMobileClient`.

All documentation is now centralized at https://aws-amplify.github.io/

### Enhancements

* **Amazon Kinesis Video Streams**
  * Improve exception handling.
  * Lower default memory allocation to 385MB to reduce crashes from over-allocation.
  * **Breaking API Changes**
    * Remove `streamName` parameter from `KinesisVideoClient.registerMediaSource()` as `MediaSource` already has the stream name in `StreamInfo`.
    * Add `KinesisVideoClient.unregisterMediaSource()` to remove `MediaSource` to `KinesisVideoProducerStream` binding from `KinesisVideoClient`. Customers can use `unregisterMediaSource()` after they stop streaming, so `MediaSource` data will not to be sent to Kinesis Video Streams.
    * Add `getStreamInfo()` to `MediaSource` instead of `MediaSourceConfiguration`. If customers have implemented their own `MediaSource` and `MediaSourceConfiguration`, they would need to provide stream information via `MediaSource.getStreamInfo()`. The `MediaSourceConfiguration.getStreamInfo()` will not work.
    * The following classes are no longer publicly available.
      * `MediaSource`
      * `MediaSourceConfiguration`
      * `MediaSourceSink`
      * `AbstractKinesisVideoClient`
      * `NativeKinesisVideoClient`
      * `BytesGenerator`

      * `ReadResult`
      * `ServiceCallbacks`
      * `com.amazonaws.kinesisvideo.service.exception.AccessDeniedException`
      * `com.amazonaws.kinesisvideo.service.exception.AmazonServiceException`
      * `com.amazonaws.kinesisvideo.service.exception.ResourceInUseException`
      * `com.amazonaws.kinesisvideo.service.exception.ResourceNotFoundException`
      * `AckConsumer`
      * `BlockingAckConsumer`
      * `DefaultServiceCallbacksImpl`

  * Preserve sign-up form fields when sign-up validation fails so that end-users can correct and try again. [issue #460](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/460)
  * Automatically sign-in user after actions such as sign-up or forgot password. [issue #460](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/issues/460)
  * Show the partially redacted destination of the MFA code on the screen when end-user needs to input a code.

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services

## [Release 2.7.4](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.7.4)

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon S3**
  * Fix a bug in specifying a custom Security Provider for client-side encryption.
  * `AmazonS3EncryptionClient` (Client-side encryption) is deprecated. You can secure your content in S3 in two ways: a) For uploads, you can encrypt the file locally using an algorithm of your choice and use the TransferUtility API to upload the encrypted file to S3. For downloads, you can use the TransferUtility API to download the file and then decrypt it using the algorithm that you used to upload the file. b) `ServerSideEncryption`: There are multiple options available for ServerSide Encryption. You can setup encryption at the S3 bucket level using the AWS S3 console. When encryption is setup at the bucket level, all objects in the bucket are encrypted. You can also use the AWS console to encrypt individual objects after they have been uploaded. Another option is to request ServerSide encryption for the object being uploaded using the SDK.
  * Fix a bug to support transfer objects with name containing special characters. '+', '*', '%7E' and '%2F' characters are URL-encoded.

## [Release 2.7.3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.7.3)

## [Release 2.7.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.7.0)

### Enhancements

* **Amazon S3**
  * Starting version `2.7.0` of the SDK, `TransferService` logic has been refactored. This service now will be responsible only for monitoring network connectivity changes. When the network goes offline, the transfers that are in progress will be paused. When the network comes back online, the transfers that are paused will be resumed. If you expect your app to perform long-running transfers in the background, you need to initiate the transfers from a background service of your choice.

  * The `TransferService` will not be started or stopped by `TransferUtility` anymore. You have to start `TransferService` manually from your application. A recommended way is to start the service upon Application startup. One way you can do this is to include the following line in the `onCreate` method of your app's Application class.

	```java
	getApplicationContext().startService(new Intent(getApplicationContext(), TransferService.class));
	```

## [Release 2.6.17](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android/releases/tag/release_v2.6.17)

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
  * Issue with Android API level 23 causing crashes when generating notification icon from a bitmap. Updated SDK behavior to only generate icon from a bitmap on API level 24 and above.
  * Fixed an issue when the userId was unset, registering for notifications would clobber the userId on the server. This overwrote any value set by `updateEndpointProfile`. Set user id to empty string to reset server user id, null to retain server value.
  * Issue with ANRs (Application Not Responding) when downloading images for notifications. Updated SDK behavior to background download image tasks.
  * Added an option to specify a custom ExecutorService through PinpointConfiguration for the TargetingClient. Use `PinpointConfiguration.withExecutor(ExecutorService)` to choose an Executor to register for Pinpoint notifications and to run handlers. Choosing a single thread Executor can be used when running handlers sequentially on the same thread after registration.

- In `ListRecordsRequest` of Cognito Sync, the data type of `lastSyncCount` is changed from String to Long and that of `maxResult` from String to Integer.
- In DynamoDB, the method `setKey(java.util.Map.Entry<String, AttributeValue> hashKey, java.util.Map.Entry<String, AttributeValue> rangeKey)` is removed from `GetItemRequest`, `UpdateItemRequest`, `DeleteItemRequest`, and `DeleteRequest`. Use `addKeyEntry(String key, AttributeValue value)` instead. `setExclusiveStartKey(java.util.Map.Entry<String, AttributeValue> hashKey, java.util.Map.Entry<String, AttributeValue> rangeKey)` is also removed from `QueryRequest` and `ScanRequest`. The alternative is `addExclusiveStartKeyEntry(String key, AttributeValue value)`.
