/**
 * <p>
 * Detects text in the input image and converts it into machine-readable text.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an
 * image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon
 * Rekognition operations, you must pass it as a reference to an image in an
 * Amazon S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not supported. The
 * image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>DetectText</code> operation returns text in an array of elements,
 * <code>TextDetections</code>. Each <code>TextDetection</code> element provides
 * information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the
 * image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not
 * separated by spaces. <code>DetectText</code> can detect up to 50 words in an
 * image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a
 * complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a
 * line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends
 * when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words.
 * This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect
 * multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent
 * the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the
 * <code>DetectText</code> operation returns multiple lines.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To determine whether a <code>TextDetection</code> element is a line of text
 * or a word, use the <code>TextDetection</code> object <code>Type</code> field.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To be detected, text must be within +/- 30 degrees orientation of the
 * horizontal axis.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see DetectText in the Amazon Rekognition Developer
 * Guide.
