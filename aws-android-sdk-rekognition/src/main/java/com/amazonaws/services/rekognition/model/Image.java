/**
 * <p>
 * Provides the input image either as bytes or an S3 object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass image bytes to a Rekognition API operation by using the
 * <code>Bytes</code> property. For example, you would use the
 * <code>Bytes</code> property to pass an image loaded from a local file system.
 * Image bytes passed by using the <code>Bytes</code> property must be
 * base64-encoded. Your code may not need to encode image bytes if you are using
 * an AWS SDK to call Rekognition API operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see Analyzing an Image Loaded from a Local File System
 * in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to a Rekognition API operation by
 * using the <code>S3Object</code> property. Images stored in an S3 bucket do
 * not need to be base64-encoded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object must match the region
 * you use for Amazon Rekognition operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you use the Amazon CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing
 * image bytes using the Bytes property is not supported. You must first upload
 * the image to an Amazon S3 bucket and then call the operation using the
 * S3Object property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object, the user must have permission
 * to access the S3 object. For more information, see Resource Based Policies in
 * the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
