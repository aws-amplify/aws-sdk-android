 * <code>PersonsWithoutRequiredEquipment</code>), and the persons in which a

 * To get a total for each category, use the size of the field array. For
 * example, to find out how many people were detected as wearing the specified
 * PPE, use the size of the <code>PersonsWithRequiredEquipment</code> array. If
 * you want to find out more about a person, such as the location
 * (<a>BoundingBox</a>) of the person on the image, use the person ID in each
