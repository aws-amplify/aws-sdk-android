/**
 * <p>
 * Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest
 * faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest
 * face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or
 * as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to
 * call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The
 * image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by
 * similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response
 * provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch,
 * role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value
 * (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face).
 * The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely
 * the faces match.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to
 * 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the
 * <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the
 * source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value,
 * landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information
 * about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face
 * and confidence value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out
 * detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is
 * based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set
 * the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or
 * <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify
 * <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of
 * the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated
 * with a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns
 * orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to
 * display the images with the correct image orientation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If no faces are detected in the source or target images,
 * <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code>
 * error.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation
 * doesn't persist.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition
 * Developer Guide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation requires permissions to perform the
 * <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code> action.
