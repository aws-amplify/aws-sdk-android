/**
 * <p>
 * Returns an array of celebrities recognized in the input image. For more
 * information, see <a>celebrities</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code> returns the 100 largest faces in the image.
 * It lists recognized celebrities in the <code>CelebrityFaces</code> array and
 * unrecognized faces in the <code>UnrecognizedFaces</code> array.
 * <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code> doesn't return celebrities whose faces are
 * not amongst the largest 100 faces in the image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each celebrity recognized, the <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code> returns
 * a <code>Celebrity</code> object. The <code>Celebrity</code> object contains
 * the celebrity name, ID, URL links to additional information, match
 * confidence, and a <code>ComparedFace</code> object that you can use to locate
 * the celebrity's face on the image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rekognition does not retain information about which images a celebrity has
 * been recognized in. Your application must store this information and use the
 * <code>Celebrity</code> ID property as a unique identifier for the celebrity.
 * If you don't store the celebrity name or additional information URLs returned
 * by <code>RecognizeCelebrities</code>, you will need the ID to identify the
 * celebrity in a call to the operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass the imput image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a
 * reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the Amazon CLI to
 * call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The
 * image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For an example, see <a>celebrities-procedure-image</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation requires permissions to perform the
 * <code>rekognition:RecognizeCelebrities</code> operation.
