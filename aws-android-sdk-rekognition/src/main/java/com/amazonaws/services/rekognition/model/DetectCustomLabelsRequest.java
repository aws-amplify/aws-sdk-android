 * <p>
 * Detects custom labels in a supplied image by using an Amazon Rekognition
 * Custom Labels model.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You specify which version of a model version to use by using the
 * <code>ProjectVersionArn</code> input parameter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to
 * an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon
 * Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must
 * be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a
 * (<code>CustomLabel</code>) object in an array (<code>CustomLabels</code>).
 * Each <code>CustomLabel</code> object provides the label name (
 * <code>Name</code>), the level of confidence that the image contains the
 * object (<code>Confidence</code>), and object location information, if it
 * exists, for the label on the image (<code>Geometry</code>).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During training model calculates a threshold value that determines if a
 * prediction for a label is true. By default, <code>DetectCustomLabels</code>
 * doesn't return labels whose confidence value is below the model's calculated
 * threshold value. To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for
 * <code>MinConfidence</code> that is higher than the model's calculated
 * threshold. You can get the model's calculated threshold from the model's
 * training results shown in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console. To
 * get all labels, regardless of confidence, specify a
 * <code>MinConfidence</code> value of 0.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also add the <code>MaxResults</code> parameter to limit the number of
 * labels returned.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist
 * any data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation requires permissions to perform the
 * <code>rekognition:DetectCustomLabels</code> action.
