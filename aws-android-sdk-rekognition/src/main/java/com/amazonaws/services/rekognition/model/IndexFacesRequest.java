/**
 * <p>
 * Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead,
 * the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input
 * image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature
 * vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses
 * feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the
 * <a>SearchFaces</a> and <a>SearchFacesByImage</a> operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon
 * Rekognition Developer Guide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To get the number of faces in a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model,
 * <code>IndexFaces</code> indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image.
 * Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the
 * input image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation
 * information is not returned in the <code>OrientationCorrection</code> field.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To determine which version of the model you're using, call
 * <a>DescribeCollection</a> and supply the collection ID. You can also get the
 * model version from the value of <code>FaceModelVersion</code> in the response
 * from <code>IndexFaces</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition
 * Developer Guide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you provide the optional <code>ExternalImageId</code> for the input image
 * you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it
 * detects. When you call the <a>ListFaces</a> operation, the response returns
 * the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side
 * index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to
 * find all faces in an image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the
 * <code>MaxFaces</code> input parameter. This is useful when you want to index
 * the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as
 * those belonging to people standing in the background.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out
 * detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is
 * based on a variety of common use cases. By default, <code>IndexFaces</code>
 * chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly
 * choose the quality bar. Use <code>QualityFilter</code>, to set the quality
 * bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>
 * . If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of
 * the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated
 * with a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in
 * an array of <a>UnindexedFace</a> objects, <code>UnindexedFaces</code>. Faces
 * aren't indexed for reasons such as:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the <code>MaxFaces</code>
 * request parameter.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The face is too blurry.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The image is too dark.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The face has an extreme pose.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In response, the <code>IndexFaces</code> operation returns an array of
 * metadata for all detected faces, <code>FaceRecords</code>. This includes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The bounding box, <code>BoundingBox</code>, of the detected face.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * A confidence value, <code>Confidence</code>, which indicates the confidence
 * that the bounding box contains a face.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * A face ID, <code>FaceId</code>, assigned by the service for each face that's
 * detected and stored.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * An image ID, <code>ImageId</code>, assigned by the service for the input
 * image.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If you request all facial attributes (by using the
 * <code>detectionAttributes</code> parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns
 * detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location
 * of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image,
 * specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the
 * <code>IndexFaces</code> operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate
 * face metadata.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a
 * reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call
 * Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image
 * must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation requires permissions to perform the
 * <code>rekognition:IndexFaces</code> action.
