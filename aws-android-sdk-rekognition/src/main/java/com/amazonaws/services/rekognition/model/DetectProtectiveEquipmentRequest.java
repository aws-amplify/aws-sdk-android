/**
 * <p>
 * Detects Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) worn by people detected in an
 * image. Amazon Rekognition can detect the following types of PPE.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Face cover
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Hand cover
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Head cover
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to
 * an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. The image must be either a PNG or JPG
 * formatted file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>DetectProtectiveEquipment</code> detects PPE worn by up to 15 persons
 * detected in an image.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For each person detected in the image the API returns an array of body parts
 * (face, head, left-hand, right-hand). For each body part, an array of detected
 * items of PPE is returned, including an indicator of whether or not the PPE
 * covers the body part. The API returns the confidence it has in each detection
 * (person, PPE, body part and body part coverage). It also returns a bounding
 * box (<a>BoundingBox</a>) for each detected person and each detected item of
 * PPE.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can optionally request a summary of detected PPE items with the
 * <code>SummarizationAttributes</code> input parameter. The summary provides
 * the following information.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The persons detected as wearing all of the types of PPE that you specify.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The persons detected as not wearing all of the types PPE that you specify.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The persons detected where PPE adornment could not be determined.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist
 * any data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation requires permissions to perform the
 * <code>rekognition:DetectProtectiveEquipment</code> action.
