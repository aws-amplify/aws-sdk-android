/**
 * EventClient is the entry point into the Amazon Mobile Analytics SDK where
 * {@link AnalyticsEvent} objects are created, recorded, and submitted to the
 * Amazon Mobile Analytics Service. <h3>Recording Events</h3> Example:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * // get the event client from your MobileAnalyticsManager instance
 * EventClient eventClient = mobileAnalyticsManager.getEventClient();
 * 
 * // create and record an event
 * Event level1CompleteEvent = eventClient.createEvent(&quot;level1Complete&quot;);
 * eventClient.recordEvent(level1CompleteEvent);
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Submitting Events</h3>
 * <p>
 * The example below demonstrates how to submit events to the Amazon Mobile
 * Analytics Service. You have direct control over when events are submitted in
 * your app. Events are submitted in a background thread.
 * </p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * // submit events to the website
 * EventClient eventClient = mobileAnalyticsManager.getEventClient();
 * eventClient.submitEvents();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Amazon recommends that you call <code>submitEvents</code> in the onPause
 * method of each Activity object that records events. The SDK ensures that you
 * do not submit events too frequently. If you try submitting events within one
 * minute of a previous submission, the submission request will be ignored.
 * <p>
 * Note: This client will store at most 5MiB of event data locally. Past that
 * events will be dropped. When events successfully submitted, they are removed
 * from the local filestore
 * </p>
