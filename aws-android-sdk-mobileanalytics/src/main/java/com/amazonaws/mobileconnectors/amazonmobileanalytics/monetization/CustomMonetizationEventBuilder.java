/**
 * Builds monetization events representing a purchase from an IAP framework not
 * defined by a specific builder. The store attribute must be set by the user.
 * This Builder will return null if the Store, ProductId, Quantity, and either
 * the Formatted Localized Price or Price and Currency are not set.
 * <p>
 * The example below demonstrates how to create a monetization event after you
 * receive a purchase confirmation from the IAP framework you are using. You are
 * responsible for storing and making sure that the bare minimum attributes
 * required to build a Custom Purchase Event are available for use at this time.
 * Note that the builder will maintain the values of its internal variables
 * between builds.
 * </p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * // get the event client from your MobileAnalyticsManager instance
 * EventClient eventClient = mobileAnalyticsManager.getEventClient();
 *
 * // create a builder that can record purchase events for the IAP Framework you
 * // are using
 * CustomMonetizationEventBuilder builder = CustomMonetizationEventBuilder.create(eventClient);
 *
 * // build the monetization event with at minimum the store, product id, quantity,
 * // and price information
 * // The price information can be supplied in either of the following ways:
 * // - The price as a double (i.e. 1.99) and the currency as a currency code (i.e.
 * // &quot;USD&quot;). This method is preferred as it provides more accuracy in the
 * // monetization reports
 * // - The formatted localized price of the item as a string (i.e. &quot;$1.99&quot;)
 * // You may also build with any additional available attributes that the IAP
 * // Framework provides such as Transaction ID
 *
 * // Price and currency
 * Event purchaseEvent = builder.withStore(&quot;Custom Store&quot;).withProductId(&quot;com.yourgame.sword&quot;)
 *         .withItemPrice(1.99).withCurrency(&quot;USD&quot;).withQuantity(1).build();
 *
 * // Formatted Price
 * purchaseEvent = builder.withStore(&quot;Custom Store&quot;).withProductId(&quot;com.yourgame.sword&quot;)
 *         .withFormattedItemPrice(&quot;$1.99&quot;).withQuantity(1).build();
 *
 * // record the monetization event
 * eventClient.recordEvent(purchaseEvent);
 * </pre>
