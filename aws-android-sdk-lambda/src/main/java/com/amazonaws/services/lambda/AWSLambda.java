     * <p>
     * Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and
     * wait for the response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function
     * asynchronously, set <code>InvocationType</code> to <code>Event</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For synchronous invocation, details about the function response,
     * including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For
     * either invocation type, you can find more information in the <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html"
     * >execution log</a> and <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/dlq.html">trace</a>.
     * To record function errors for asynchronous invocations, configure your
     * function with a <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/dlq.html">dead letter
     * queue</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry
     * behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type.
     * For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an
     * error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more
     * information, see <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/retries-on-errors.html"
     * >Retry Behavior</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors.
     * Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from
     * executing, such as permissions errors, <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html">limit
     * errors</a>, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For
     * example, Lambda returns <code>TooManyRequestsException</code> if
     * executing the function would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at
     * either the account level (<code>ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>)
     * or function level (
     * <code>ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected
     * during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure
     * your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for
     * long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings.
