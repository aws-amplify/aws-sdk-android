/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.ec2.AmazonEC2#createReservedInstancesListing(CreateReservedInstancesListingRequest) CreateReservedInstancesListing operation}.
 * <p>
 * Creates a listing for Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances to be sold in the
 * Reserved Instance Marketplace. You can submit one Reserved Instance
 * listing at a time. To get a list of your Reserved Instances, you can
 * use the DescribeReservedInstances operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell
 * Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who
 * want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and
 * sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other
 * Reserved Instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To sell your Reserved Instances, you must first register as a seller
 * in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. After completing the
 * registration process, you can create a Reserved Instance Marketplace
 * listing of some or all of your Reserved Instances, and specify the
 * upfront price to receive for them. Your Reserved Instance listings
 * then become available for purchase. To view the details of your
 * Reserved Instance listing, you can use the
 * DescribeReservedInstancesListings operation.
