 * <p>
 * Modifies the specified Spot fleet request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * While the Spot fleet request is being modified, it is in the
 * <code>modifying</code> state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To scale up your Spot fleet, increase its target capacity. The Spot
 * fleet launches the additional Spot instances according to the
 * allocation strategy for the Spot fleet request. If the allocation
 * strategy is <code>lowestPrice</code> , the Spot fleet launches
 * instances using the Spot pool with the lowest price. If the allocation
 * strategy is <code>diversified</code> , the Spot fleet distributes the
 * instances across the Spot pools.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To scale down your Spot fleet, decrease its target capacity. First,
 * the Spot fleet cancels any open bids that exceed the new target
 * capacity. You can request that the Spot fleet terminate Spot instances
 * until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity.
 * If the allocation strategy is <code>lowestPrice</code> , the Spot
 * fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the
 * allocation strategy is <code>diversified</code> , the Spot fleet
 * terminates instances across the Spot pools. Alternatively, you can
 * request that the Spot fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but
 * not replace any Spot instances that are interrupted or that you
 * terminate manually.
