/**
 * <p>
 * Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly
 * stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are
 * released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root
 * partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and
 * you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at
 * any time. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you
 * for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a
 * new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance
 * hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was
 * stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a
 * one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for
 * instance usage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be
 * restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its
 * root device returns an error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html"
 * >Stopping Instances</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
 * Guide</i>.
