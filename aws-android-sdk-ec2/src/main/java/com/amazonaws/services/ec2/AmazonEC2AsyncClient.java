     * </p>

     * <ul>
     * <li> <p>
     * <i>public</i> : The owner of the snapshot granted create volume

     * accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li> <p>
     * <i>explicit</i> : The owner of the snapshot granted create volume
     * permissions to a specific AWS account.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li> <p>
     * <i>implicit</i> : An AWS account has implicit create volume
     * permissions for all snapshots it owns.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     *

     * which you have create volume permissions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the
     * specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an
     * error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not
     * have access, it is not included in the returned results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you specify one or more snapshot owners, only snapshots from the
     * specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The
     * results can include the AWS account IDs of the specified owners,
     * <code>amazon</code> for snapshots owned by Amazon, or
     * <code>self</code> for snapshots that you own.
     * </p>
     * <p>

     * snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify AWS
     * account IDs (if you own the snapshots), <code>self</code> for
     * snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or
     * <code>all</code> for public snapshots.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are describing a long list of snapshots, you can paginate the
     * output to make the list more manageable. The <code>MaxResults</code>
