/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.ec2.AmazonEC2#stopInstances(StopInstancesRequest) StopInstances operation}.
 * <p>
 * Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We don't charge hourly usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer
 * fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains,
 * continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS
 * volume usage. Each time you transition an instance from stopped to
 * started, Amazon EC2 charges a full instance hour, even if transitions
 * happen multiple times within a single hour.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can't start or stop Spot instances, and you can't stop instance
 * store-backed instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you stop an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your
 * instance at any time. Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in
 * a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not
 * preserve data stored in RAM.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Stopping an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For
 * example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other
 * devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an
 * instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the
 * instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about
 * the differences between rebooting, stopping, and terminating
 * instances, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html"> Instance Lifecycle </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a
 * short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state
 * after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host
 * computer. For more information, see
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html"> Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance </a>
 * in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i> .
