 * transcriptions. Note that in order to apply categories to your
 * transcriptions, you must create them before submitting your transcription

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When creating a new category, you can use the <code>InputType</code>
 * parameter to label the category as a batch category (<code>POST_CALL</code>)
 * or a streaming category (<code>REAL_TIME</code>). Batch categories can only
 * be applied to batch transcriptions and streaming categories can only be
 * applied to streaming transcriptions. If you do not include
 * <code>InputType</code>, your category is created as a batch category by
 * default.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Call Analytics categories are composed of rules. For each category, you must
 * create between 1 and 20 rules. Rules can include these parameters: , , , and
