/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Cognito Sync <fullname>Amazon Cognito
 * Sync</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable
 * cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client
 * libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries
 * to persist data locally so that it's available even if the device is offline.
 * Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access
 * the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and
 * credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of
 * key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible
 * only to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito
 * Sync service, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with <a
 * href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html"
 * >Amazon Cognito Identity service</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will
 * probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see
 * the <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html"
 * >Developer Guide for Android</a> and the <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html"
 * >Developer Guide for iOS</a>.
