     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Although you can customize the message headers when using the

     * If your account is still in the <a href=

     * <li>

     * address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:,
     * CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50
     * recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups

     * authenticated using DKIM.
     * </p>

     * <important>
     * <p>
     * When you execute the <code>VerifyDomainDkim</code> operation, the domain
     * that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated
     * with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated
     * the domain with your account by using the
     * <code>VerifyDomainIdentity</code> operation. However, you can't send
     * email from the domain until you either successfully <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html"
     * >verify it</a> or you successfully <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html"
     * >set up DKIM for it</a>.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME
     * records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the
     * DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that
     * domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT
     * record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS
     * configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is
     * authenticated using DKIM.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following
     * values:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Name</b>: <i>token</i>._domainkey.<i>example.com</i>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Type</b>: CNAME
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Value</b>: <i>token</i>.dkim.amazonses.com
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In the preceding example, replace <i>token</i> with one of the tokens
     * that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace
     * <i>example.com</i> with your domain. Repeat this process for each token
     * that's generated by this operation.
     * </p>
