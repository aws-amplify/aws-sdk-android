/**
 * <p>
 * Composes an email message using an email template and immediately queues it
 * for sending.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to send email using the <code>SendTemplatedEmail</code> operation,
 * your call to the API must meet the following requirements:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email
 * templates using the <a>CreateTemplate</a> operation.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to
 * verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the
 * Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html"
 * >Verifying Email Addresses and Domains</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer
 * Guide.</i>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The maximum message size is 10 MB.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Calls to the <code>SendTemplatedEmail</code> operation may only include one
 * <code>Destination</code> parameter. A destination is a set of recipients who
 * will receive the same version of the email. The <code>Destination</code>
 * parameter can include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC:
 * fields.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The <code>Destination</code> parameter must include at least one recipient
 * email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or
 * a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not
 * in the format <i>UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain</i>), the entire
 * message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that
 * are valid.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * If your call to the <code>SendTemplatedEmail</code> operation includes all of
 * the required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns a Message ID.
 * However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because the template contains
 * errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted
 * the message, Amazon SES doesn't return a message stating that it was unable
 * to send the email.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to send you
 * notifications when Rendering Failure events occur. For more information, see
 * <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-personalized-email-api.html"
 * >Sending Personalized Email Using the Amazon SES API</a> in the <i>Amazon
 * Simple Email Service Developer Guide</i>.
