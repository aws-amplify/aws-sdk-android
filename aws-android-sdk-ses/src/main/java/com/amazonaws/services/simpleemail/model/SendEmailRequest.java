 * Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. In order to
 * send email using the <code>SendEmail</code> operation, your message must meet
 * the following requirements:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If you
 * attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the operation
 * will result in an "Email address not verified" error.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to
 * verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the
 * Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html"
 * >Verifying Email Addresses and Domains</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer
 * Guide.</i>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The maximum message size is 10 MB.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The message must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient
 * address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a
 * recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format
 * <i>UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain</i>), the entire message will
 * be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and
 * BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you
 * can divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call the
 * <code>SendEmail</code> operation several times to send the message to each
 * group.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including
 * each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the
 * maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your <i>sending
 * quota</i>). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see <a
 * href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/manage-sending-limits.html"
