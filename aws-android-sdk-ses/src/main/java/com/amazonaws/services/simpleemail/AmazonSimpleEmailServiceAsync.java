     * <p>
     * Amazon SES has a limit on the total number of recipients per message. The
     * combined number of To:, CC: and BCC: email addresses cannot exceed 50. If
     * you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can divide
     * your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call Amazon SES
     * repeatedly to send the message to each group.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The To:, CC:, and BCC: headers in the raw message can contain a group
     * list. Note that each recipient in a group list counts towards the
     * 50-recipient limit.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (To:, CC:
     * and BCC:) is counted against your sending quota - the maximum number of
     * emails you can send in a 24-hour period. For information about your
     * sending quota, go to the <a href=
     * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/manage-sending-limits.html"

     * <p>
     * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user,
     * <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account
     * identity for the email's "Source," "From," and "Return-Path" parameters
     * in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters
     * <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or
     * <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or you can include the following
     * X-headers in the header of your raw email:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature, because they are
     * removed by Amazon SES before sending the email.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * For the most common sending authorization use case, we recommend that you
     * specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> and do not specify either the
     * <code>FromIdentityArn</code> or <code>ReturnPathIdentityArn</code>. (The
     * same note applies to the corresponding X-headers.) If you only specify
     * the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code>, Amazon SES will simply set the "From"
     * address and the "Return Path" address to the identity specified in
     * <code>SourceIdentityArn</code>. For more information about sending
     * authorization, see the <a href=
