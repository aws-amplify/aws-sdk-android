     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Although you can customize the message headers when using the
     * <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply
     * its own <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you
     * passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten
     * by the values that Amazon SES provides.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user,
     * <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account
     * identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one
     * of two ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>,
     * <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or
     * you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature; Amazon SES will
     * remove them before sending the email.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * For most common sending authorization scenarios, we recommend that you
     * specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter and not the
     * <code>FromIdentityArn</code> or <code>ReturnPathIdentityArn</code>
     * parameters. If you only specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code>
     * parameter, Amazon SES will set the From and Return Path addresses to the

     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient
     * address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one
     * of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's not in
     * the format <i>UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain</i>), Amazon SES

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:,
     * CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50
     * recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups
     * of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group.

     * Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME
     * message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your
     * message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content
     * isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all
     * content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-raw.html#send-email-mime-encoding"

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the
     * <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Although you can customize the message headers when using the
     * <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply
     * its own <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you
     * passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten
     * by the values that Amazon SES provides.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user,
     * <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account
     * identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one
     * of two ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>,
     * <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or
     * you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature; Amazon SES will
     * remove them before sending the email.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * For most common sending authorization scenarios, we recommend that you
     * specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter and not the
     * <code>FromIdentityArn</code> or <code>ReturnPathIdentityArn</code>
     * parameters. If you only specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code>
     * parameter, Amazon SES will set the From and Return Path addresses to the
     * identity specified in <code>SourceIdentityArn</code>. For more
     * information about sending authorization, see the <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html"

     * For every message that you send, the total number of recipients
     * (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
     * against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period
     * (your <i>sending quota</i>). For more information about sending quotas in

     * Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.
     * </p>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * When you execute the <code>VerifyDomainDkim</code> operation, the domain
     * that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated
     * with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated
     * the domain with your account by using the
     * <code>VerifyDomainIdentity</code> operation. However, you can't send
     * email from the domain until you either successfully <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html"
     * >verify it</a> or you successfully <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html"
     * >set up DKIM for it</a>.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME
     * records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the
     * DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that
     * domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT
     * record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS
     * configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is
     * authenticated using DKIM.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following
     * values:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Name</b>: <i>token</i>._domainkey.<i>example.com</i>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Type</b>: CNAME
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Value</b>: <i>token</i>.dkim.amazonses.com
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In the preceding example, replace <i>token</i> with one of the tokens
     * that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace
     * <i>example.com</i> with your domain. Repeat this process for each token
     * that's generated by this operation.
     * </p>

     * You can execute this operation no more than once per second.
