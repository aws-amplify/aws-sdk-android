/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.simpledb.AmazonSimpleDB#select(SelectRequest) Select operation}.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Select</code> operation returns a set of attributes for
 * <code>ItemNames</code> that match the select expression.
 * <code>Select</code> is similar to the standard SQL SELECT statement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB in total size.
 * Amazon SimpleDB automatically adjusts the number of items returned per
 * page to enforce this limit. For example, if the client asks to
 * retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 kB in size, the
 * system returns 100 items and an appropriate <code>NextToken</code> so
 * the client can access the next page of results.
 * </p>

 * For information on how to construct select expressions, see Using
 * Select to Create Amazon SimpleDB Queries in the Developer Guide.
