/**
 * <p>The transactional data APIs for Amazon QLDB</p> <note> <p>Instead of interacting directly with this API, we recommend that you use the Amazon QLDB Driver or the QLDB Shell to execute data transactions on a ledger.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you are working with an AWS SDK, use the QLDB Driver. The driver provides a high-level abstraction layer above this <code>qldbsession</code> data plane and manages <code>SendCommand</code> API calls for you. For information and a list of supported programming languages, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-driver.html">Getting started with the driver</a> in the <i>Amazon QLDB Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), use the QLDB Shell. The shell is a command line interface that uses the QLDB Driver to interact with a ledger. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/data-shell.html">Accessing Amazon QLDB using the QLDB Shell</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
