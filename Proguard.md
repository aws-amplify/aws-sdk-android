# Using ProGuard with the AWS SDK for Android

Users should receive ProGuard rules automatically.
See [the `aws-android-sdk-core` package](aws-android-sdk-core/consumer-proguard-rules.pro) and
[Android considerations](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library#Considerations).

**Note:** The ProGuard configuration mentioned above applies to the AWS SDK for Android.
If you are using other third-party libraries, you need to consult the documentation
for those libraries to see if they require additional configuration to support the use of ProGuard.

## Additional Resources

The configuration provided in this article allows developers to ship apps using the AWS SDK for Android
that use less of the userâ€™s storage.

All samples in the AWS SDK for Android starting with version 1.3.0 ship with functional ProGuard configurations.
You can download the latest version of the AWS SDK for Android [here](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).
