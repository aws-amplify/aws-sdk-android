# Using ProGuard with the AWS SDK for Android

* R8 users receive ProGuard rules automatically.
  See [the `aws-android-sdk-core` package](aws-android-sdk-core/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/amazon-sdk.pro) and
  [R8 conventions](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code).
* ProGuard users should include [rules](aws-android-sdk-core/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/amazon-sdk.pro)
  on their own.

**Note:** The ProGuard configuration mentioned above applies to the AWS SDK for Android.
If you are using other third-party libraries, you need to consult the documentation
for those libraries to see if they require additional configuration to support the use of ProGuard.

## Additional Resources

The configuration provided in this article allows developers to ship apps using the AWS SDK for Android
that use less of the userâ€™s storage.

All samples in the AWS SDK for Android starting with version 1.3.0 ship with functional ProGuard configurations.
You can download the latest version of the AWS SDK for Android [here](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).
