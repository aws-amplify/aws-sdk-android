For new projects, we recommend interacting with AWS using the [Amplify Framework](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/android).

The AWS SDK for Android is a collection of low-level libraries for direct interaction with AWS backend services. For use cases not covered by the Amplify Framework, you may directly integrate these clients into your Android app.

## Installation

The AWS SDK for Android can be directly embedded via `.aar` files, or you can download it from the Maven Central repository, by integrating it into your Android project's Gradle files.

### From Maven
We recommend obtaining the dependency from Maven. To do so, add a dependency to your app's (module-level) `build.gradle`, in the `dependencies` section:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-SERVICE:2.x.y'
}
```

Above, SERVICE might be `s3`, `ddb`, `pinpoint`, etc. A full list is provided below.

### Downloading SDK libraries

You can also download a `.zip` file containg `.aar` files for each of the SDK modules, [here](https://sdk-for-android.amazonwebservices.com/latest/aws-android-sdk.zip).

Add the aar files to a folder in your project called `libs` (create one if it doesn't already exist).

Ensure that the `libs` directory is included in your module-level `build.gradle`, under the `dependencies` block:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.aar'])
}
```

## SDK Fundamentals
There are a few fundamentals that are helpful to know when developing against the AWS SDK for Android.

* Never embed credentials in an Android application.  It is trivially easy to decompile applications and steal embedded credentials.  Always use temporarily vended credentials from services such as Amazon Cognito Identity.
* Unless explicitly stated, calls are synchronous and must be taken off of the main thread.
* Unless explicitly stated, calls can always throw an AmazonServiceException or an AmazonClientException (depending on if the exception is generated by the service or the client respectively).
* The SDK will handle re-trying requests automatically, but unless explicitly stated will throw an exception if it cannot contact AWS.
* We are always looking to help, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android/issues).

## Versioning

The Android SDK is versioned like `2.x.y`. `2` is a product identifier that never changes. `x` is bumped when there are breaking changes. `y` is bumped for not-breaking bugfixes, or for the introduction of new features/capabilities.

## Building the SDK
### Pre-requisites
The AWS Core Runtime (`aws-android-sdk-core`) module builds against Android API Level 23. Please download and install Android API Level 23 through SDK Manager in Android Studio, before building the SDK.

Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable, to the root directory of your Android SDK installation.

_For example_, on a Mac OS X where Android Studio has been installed, the SDK comes bundled with it.
```shell
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
```

### Build
```shell
./gradlew build
```
