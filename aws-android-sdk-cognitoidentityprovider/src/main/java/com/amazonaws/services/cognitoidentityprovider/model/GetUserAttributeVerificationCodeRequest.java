 * This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US

     *            invokes the function that is assigned to the <i>custom
     *            message</i> trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this
     *            function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function
     *            receives as input. This payload contains a
     *            <code>clientMetadata</code> attribute, which provides the data
     *            that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your
     *            GetUserAttributeVerificationCode request. In your function
     *            code in Lambda, you can process the
     *            <code>clientMetadata</code> value to enhance your workflow for
     *            your specific needs.
