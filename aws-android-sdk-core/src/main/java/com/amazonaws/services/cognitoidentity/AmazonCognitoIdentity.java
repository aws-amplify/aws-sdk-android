/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Cognito Identity <fullname>Amazon Cognito
 * Federated Identities</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped
 * temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It
 * uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity
 * over the lifetime of an application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with
 * one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with
 * Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
 * unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier
 * for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security
 * Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito
 * Developer Guide see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html"
 * >Authentication Flow</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information see <a href=
