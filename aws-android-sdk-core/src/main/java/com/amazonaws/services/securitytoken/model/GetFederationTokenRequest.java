/**
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key
 * ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A
 * typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
 * credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network.
 * You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the
 * long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is
 * appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually
 * in a server-based application. For a comparison of
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code> with the other API operations that produce
 * temporary credentials, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html"
 * >Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison"
 * >Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
 * users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google,
 * or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend
 * that you use <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity"
 * >Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security
 * credentials of an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead,
 * we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy
 * application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users
 * to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more
 * information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html"
 * >IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Session duration</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900
 * seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The
 * default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials
 * that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum
 * duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Permissions</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the temporary credentials created by
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any AWS service except the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You must pass an inline or managed <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session"
 * >session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy
 * document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10
 * managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you
 * use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048
 * characters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a
 * policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When
 * you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of
 * the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you
 * a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot
 * use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in
 * the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session"
 * >Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about
 * using <code>GetFederationToken</code> to create temporary security
 * credentials, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken"
 * >GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based
 * policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in
 * the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the
 * permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition
 * to the permissions granted by the session policies.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Tags</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called
 * session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html"
 * >Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session
 * tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to
 * pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html"
 * >Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM
 * User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means
 * that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and
 * <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are
 * federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you
 * pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag.
 * <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate
 * tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the
 * user tag.
