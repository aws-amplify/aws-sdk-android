/**
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key
 * ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A
 * typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
 * credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network.
 * Because you must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> action using the
 * long-term security credentials of an IAM user, this call is appropriate in
 * contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a
 * server-based application. For a comparison of <code>GetFederationToken</code>
 * with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html"
 * >Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison"
 * >Comparing the AWS STS APIs</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * If you are creating a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
 * users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google,
 * or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, we recommend that you use
 * <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> or
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>. For more information, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity"
 * >Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * The <code>GetFederationToken</code> action must be called by using the
 * long-term AWS security credentials of an IAM user. You can also call
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an AWS root
 * account, but we do not recommended it. Instead, we recommend that you create
 * an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application and then attach a policy
 * to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources
 * that they need access to. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html"
 * >IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the long-term
 * credentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified duration, from 900
 * seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximium of 129600 seconds (36 hours). The
 * default is 43200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained
 * by using AWS root account credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds
 * (1 hour).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code>
 * can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following
 * exceptions:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You cannot use these credentials to call any IAM APIs.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You cannot call any STS APIs.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Permissions</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code> are determined by a combination of the
 * following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials
 * are used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The policy that is passed as a parameter in the call.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials that
 * result from the <code>GetFederationToken</code> API call--that is, to the
 * <i>federated user</i>. When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS
 * evaluates the policy attached to the federated user in combination with the
 * policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials were used to
 * call <code>GetFederationToken</code>. AWS allows the federated user's request
 * only when both the federated user <i> <b>and</b> </i> the IAM user are
 * explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot
 * grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user policy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials
 * are used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code> are designed to allow access
 * to all the actions and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for
 * individual users, you pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the
 * permissions to a level that's appropriate to that individual user, using a
 * policy that allows only a subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM
 * user.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials
 * have no effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary
 * security credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based
 * policy that specifically allows the federated user to access the resource.
 * </p>
 * <p>

 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_getfederationtoken.html"
 * >Permissions for GetFederationToken</a>. For information about using
