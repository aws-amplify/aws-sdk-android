/**
 * Client for accessing AWS Security Token Service. All service calls made using
 * this client are blocking, and will not return until the service call
 * completes.
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to
 * request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access
 * Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).
 * This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed
 * information about using this service, go to <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html"
 * >Temporary Security Credentials</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the
 * API, go to <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html"
 * >Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For
 * general information about the Query API, go to <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html"
 * >Making Query Requests</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>. For information about using
 * security tokens with other AWS products, go to <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html"
 * >AWS Services That Work with IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a
 * specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical documentation at
 * <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">http://aws.amazon.com/
 * documentation/</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global
 * service, and all AWS STS requests go to a single endpoint at
 * <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Global requests map to the US East
 * (N. Virginia) region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints instead
 * of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase
 * session token validity. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html"
 * >Managing AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Most AWS Regions are enabled for operations in all AWS services by default.
 * Those Regions are automatically activated for use with AWS STS. Some Regions,
 * such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), must be manually enabled. To learn more
 * about enabling and disabling AWS Regions, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html"
 * >Managing AWS Regions</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. When you
 * enable these AWS Regions, they are automatically activated for use with AWS
 * STS. You cannot activate the STS endpoint for a Region that is disabled.
 * Tokens that are valid in all AWS Regions are longer than tokens that are
 * valid in Regions that are enabled by default. Changing this setting might
 * affect existing systems where you temporarily store tokens. For more
 * information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-manage-tokens"
 * >Managing Global Endpoint Session Tokens</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After you activate a Region for use with AWS STS, you can direct AWS STS API
 * calls to that Region. AWS STS recommends that you provide both the Region and
 * endpoint when you make calls to a Regional endpoint. You can provide the
 * Region alone for manually enabled Regions, such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong).
 * In this case, the calls are directed to the STS Regional endpoint. However,
 * if you provide the Region alone for Regions enabled by default, the calls are
 * directed to the global endpoint of <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To view the list of AWS STS endpoints and whether they are active by default,
 * see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#id_credentials_temp_enable-regions_writing_code"
 * >Writing Code to Use AWS STS Regions</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Recording API requests</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for
 * your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using
 * information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were
 * successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you activate AWS STS endpoints in Regions other than the default global
 * endpoint, then you must also turn on CloudTrail logging in those Regions.
 * This is necessary to record any AWS STS API calls that are made in those
 * Regions. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/aggregating_logs_regions_turn_on_ct.html"
 * >Turning On CloudTrail in Additional Regions</a> in the <i>AWS CloudTrail
 * User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a global service with a single endpoint
 * at <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code>. Calls to this endpoint are logged
 * as calls to a global service. However, because this endpoint is physically
 * located in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, your logs list
 * <code>us-east-1</code> as the event Region. CloudTrail does not write these
 * logs to the US East (Ohio) Region unless you choose to include global service
 * logs in that Region. CloudTrail writes calls to all Regional endpoints to
 * their respective Regions. For example, calls to sts.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
 * are published to the US East (Ohio) Region and calls to
 * sts.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com are published to the EU (Frankfurt) Region.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log
 * files, see the <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html"
 * >AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>.

     * to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can
     * have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum

     * <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * (Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session"
     * >session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON
     * policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify
     * up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain
     * text that you use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't
     * exceed 2048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new
     * temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the
     * intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
     * policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS
     * API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You

     * <p>
     * To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be
     * trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's
     * trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which
     * accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
     * permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The
     * administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
     * <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If
     * the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of
     * the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a
     * different account).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy.
     * Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to
     * assume the role. For more information about trust policies and
     * resource-based policies, see <a href=

     * <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
     * when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account
     * scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been
     * authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy
     * of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA
     * authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the
     * request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy
     * that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code>
     * </p>

     * credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the
     * application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services
     * that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * By default, the temporary security credentials created by
     * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you
     * can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify
     * the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds
     * (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role.
