/**
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
 * authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider,
 * such as Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID
 * Connect-compatible identity provider.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can
 * use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS
 * SDK for iOS</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS
 * SDK for Android</a> to uniquely identify a user and supply the user with a
 * consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840"
 * >Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for Android Developer
 * Guide</i> guide and <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664"
 * >Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of
 * AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for
 * example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials
 * without including long-term AWS credentials in the application, and without
 * deploying server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials.
 * Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the
 * web identity provider. For a comparison of
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other APIs that produce
 * temporary credentials, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html"
 * >Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison"
 * >Comparing the AWS STS APIs</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access
 * key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these
 * temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service APIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, which can be from 900 seconds (15
 * minutes) to a maximum of 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials created by
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any
 * AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS service's
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> APIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you
 * choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are
 * returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access
 * policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this
 * operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the
 * operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of
 * the role that is being assumed, <i> <b>and</b> </i> the policy that you pass.
 * This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting
 * temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant
 * permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the
 * role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html"
 * >Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and
 * AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you
 * must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a
 * role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes
 * must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token.
 * In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust
 * policy.
 * </p>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your
 * AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a
 * href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims"
 * >Subject</a> of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid
 * using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For
 * example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a
 * href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes"
 * >suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.
 * </p>
