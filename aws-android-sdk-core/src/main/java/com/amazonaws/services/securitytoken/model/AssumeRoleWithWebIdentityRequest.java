/**
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
 * authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider.
 * Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook,
 * Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can
 * use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">AWS
 * SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">AWS SDK for Android Developer
 * Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a
 * consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840"
 * >Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</i>
 * and <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664"
 * >Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of
 * AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for
 * example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials
 * without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also
 * don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS
 * credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a
 * token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that
 * produce temporary credentials, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html"
 * >Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison"
 * >Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access
 * key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these
 * temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default, the temporary security credentials created by
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can
 * use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the
 * duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15
 * minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This
 * setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the
 * maximum value for your role, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session"
 * >View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User
 * Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the
 * <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI
 * commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to
 * create a console URL. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html"
 * >Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials created by
 * <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any
 * AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API
 * operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * (Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session"
 * >session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy
 * document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10
 * managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you
 * use for both inline and managed session policies shouldn't exceed 2048
 * characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary
 * credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the
 * role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's
 * temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the
 * account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more
 * permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that
 * is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session"
 * >Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you
 * must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a
 * role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes
 * must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token.
 * In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust
 * policy.
 * </p>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your
 * AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a
 * href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims"
 * >Subject</a> of the provided Web Identity Token. We recommend that you avoid
 * using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For
 * example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a
 * href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes"
 * >suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.
