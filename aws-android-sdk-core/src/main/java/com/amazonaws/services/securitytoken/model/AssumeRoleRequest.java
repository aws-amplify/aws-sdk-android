/**
 * <p>
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key
 * ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can use to access AWS
 * resources that you might not normally have access to. Typically, you use
 * <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access or federation. For a
 * comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with the other APIs that produce
 * temporary credentials, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html"
 * >Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison"
 * >Comparing the AWS STS APIs</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>AssumeRole</code> by using AWS root
 * account credentials; access is denied. You must use credentials for an IAM
 * user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to
 * access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in
 * each account to access those resources. However, managing all those
 * credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time
 * consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one
 * account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other
 * accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about
 * roles, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html"
 * >IAM Roles (Delegation and Federation)</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS
 * Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system
 * in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS
 * in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user
 * has been authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the
 * role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials
 * for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a
 * sign-in URL that users can use to access the console. For more information,
 * see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction"
 * >Common Scenarios for Temporary Credentials</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you
 * specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code>, which can be from 900 seconds
 * (15 minutes) to a maximum of 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be
 * used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you
 * cannot call the STS service's <code>GetFederationToken</code> or
 * <code>GetSessionToken</code> APIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you
 * choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are
 * returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access
 * policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this
 * operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the
 * operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of
 * the role that is being assumed, <i> <b>and</b> </i> the policy that you pass.
 * This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting
 * temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant
 * permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the
 * role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html"
 * >Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and
 * AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust
 * relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created.
 * That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate access to
 * this account's role.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The user who wants to access the role must also have permissions delegated
 * from the role's administrator. If the user is in a different account than the
 * role, then the user's administrator must attach a policy that allows the user
 * to call AssumeRole on the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user
 * is in the same account as the role, then you can either attach a policy to
 * the user (identical to the previous different account user), or you can add
 * the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when
 * you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios
 * in which you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has
 * been authenticated using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust
 * policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA
 * authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA information, the
 * request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that
 * tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html"
 * >Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the
 * <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The
 * <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA
 * device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP)
 * that the MFA devices produces.
