     * Skips over and discards <code>n</code> bytes of data from this input
     * stream, while taking the skipped bytes into account for digest
     * calculation. The <code>skip</code> method may, for a variety of reasons,
     * end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes, possibly
     * <code>0</code>. This may result from any of a number of conditions;
     * reaching end of file before <code>n</code> bytes have been skipped is
     * only one possibility. The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If
     * <code>n</code> is negative, no bytes are skipped.
     * <p>
     * The <code>skip</code> method of this class creates a byte array and then
     * repeatedly reads into it until <code>n</code> bytes have been read or the
     * end of the stream has been reached. Subclasses are encouraged to provide
     * a more efficient implementation of this method. For instance, the
     * implementation may depend on the ability to seek.
     *
     * @param n the number of bytes to be skipped.
     * @return the actual number of bytes skipped.
