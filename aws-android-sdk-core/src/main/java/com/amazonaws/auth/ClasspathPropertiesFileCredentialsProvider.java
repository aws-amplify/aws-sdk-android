 * {@link AWSCredentialsProvider} implementation that loads AWS security

 * use from the classpath can also be controled through the one-argument
 * constructor.
 * <p>
 * The AWS access key ID is expected to be in the <code>accessKey</code>
 * property and the AWS secret key is expected to be in the
 * <code>secretKey</code> property.
