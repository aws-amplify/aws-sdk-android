/**
 * Interface for an HTTP client. Its main responsibility is to execute an
 * {@link HttpRequest} and return a {@link HttpResponse}. There are some
 * requirements for its implementation.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Execute the request without any modification. An {@link HttpRequest} is
 * converted from an {@link AmazonWebServiceRequest} with signature information.
 * If modified, the request is likely to be rejected by AWS service.</li>
 * <li>Disable retry logic and redirect which are handled by the service client
 * itself.</li>
 * <li>Enable {@link BrowserCompatHostnameVerifier} so that a wildcard (such as
 * "*.amazonaws.com") matches all subdomains, including "a.b.amazonaws.com".
 * This is needed for S3 virtual hosting. See <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html"
 * >Virtual Hosting of Buckets</a> for more details.</li>
 * <li>Beware of the Expect 100-continue header. Currently it's only used in <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html">S3's
 * Put Object API</a>. S3 can fail the request with a status code other than 100
 * (continue) or 417 (reject) an an error message in the body.</li>
 * <li>Cache is unnecessary and isn't recommended to implement until it's
 * supported by AWS service.</li>
