/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Cost Explorer Service
 * <p>
 * The Cost Explorer API enables you to programmatically query your cost and
 * usage data. You can query for aggregated data such as total monthly costs or
 * total daily usage. You can also query for granular data, such as the number
 * of daily write operations for Amazon DynamoDB database tables in your
 * production environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Service Endpoint
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Cost Explorer API provides the following endpoint:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
