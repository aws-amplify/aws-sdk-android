 * your host computer.

 * <p>
 * After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it. Completed snapshots of
 * the gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the gateway, however,
 * pending snapshots will not complete. After you delete a gateway, your next
 * step is to remove it from your environment.

 * You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is deleted; however,
 * your existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will continue to be billed
 * for these snapshots. You can choose to remove all remaining Amazon EBS
 * snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2 subscription.  If you prefer not to
 * cancel your Amazon EC2 subscription, you can delete your snapshots using the
 * Amazon EC2 console. For more information, see the <a
