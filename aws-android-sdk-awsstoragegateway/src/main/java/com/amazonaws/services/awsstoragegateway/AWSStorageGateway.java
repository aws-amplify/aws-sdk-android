/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Storage Gateway <fullname>AWS Storage Gateway
 * Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software
 * appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration
 * between an organization's on-premises IT environment and the AWS storage
 * infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS
 * Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the following links to get started using the <i>AWS Storage Gateway
 * Service API Reference</i>:

 * <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders"

 * AWS Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints:</a> Provides a list of each AWS
 * Region and the endpoints available for use with AWS Storage Gateway.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these
 * resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase.
 * You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For
 * example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be
 * <code>vol-AA22BB012345DAF670</code>. When you use this ID with the EC2 API,
 * you must change it to <code>vol-aa22bb012345daf670</code>. Otherwise, the EC2
 * API might not behave as expected.
 * </p>
 * </note> <important>
 * <p>
 * IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway
 * volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new
 * volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in
 * April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your
 * systems with the new format. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2 and EBS
 * Resource IDs</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID
 * format looks like the following:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG</code>
 * .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following:
 * <code>snap-78e226633445566ee</code>.
 * </p>
