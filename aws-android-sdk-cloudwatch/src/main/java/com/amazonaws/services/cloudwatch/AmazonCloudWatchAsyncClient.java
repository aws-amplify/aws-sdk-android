/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon CloudWatch asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the
 * applications you run on AWS in real-time. You can use CloudWatch to collect
 * and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your
 * resources and applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the
 * resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you
 * can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon Elastic
 * Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then use this data to determine
 * whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You
 * can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can
 * monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide
 * visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
 * operational health.
 * </p>

     * When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set

     * <code>StateValue</code> is set appropriately. Any actions associated with
     * the <code>StateValue</code> is then executed.

     * <note> When updating an existing alarm, its <code>StateValue</code> is
     * left unchanged. </note> <note> If you are using an AWS Identity and
     * Access Management (IAM) account to create or modify an alarm, you must
     * have the following Amazon EC2 permissions:
     * <ul>
     * <li><code>ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus</code> and
     * <code>ec2:DescribeInstances</code> for all alarms on Amazon EC2 instance
     * status metrics.</li>

     * <li><code>ec2:TerminateInstances</code> for alarms with terminate
     * actions.</li>
     * <li><code>ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute</code>, and
     * <code>ec2:RecoverInstances</code> for alarms with recover actions.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for
     * Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm but the stop or terminate
     * actions won't be performed on the Amazon EC2 instance. However, if you
     * are later granted permission to use the associated Amazon EC2 APIs, the
     * alarm actions you created earlier will be performed. For more information
     * about IAM permissions, see <a href=
     * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com//IAM/latest/UserGuide/PermissionsAndPolicies.html"
     * >Permissions and Policies</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are using an IAM role (e.g., an Amazon EC2 instance profile), you
     * cannot stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you
     * can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as
     * Amazon SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are using temporary security credentials granted using the AWS
     * Security Token Service (AWS STS), you cannot stop or terminate an Amazon
     * EC2 instance using alarm actions.
