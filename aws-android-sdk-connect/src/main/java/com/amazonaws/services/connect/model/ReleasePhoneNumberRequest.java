/**
 * <p>
 * Releases a phone number previously claimed to an Amazon Connect instance or
 * traffic distribution group. You can call this API only in the Amazon Web
 * Services Region where the number was claimed.
 * </p>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * To release phone numbers from a traffic distribution group, use the
 * <code>ReleasePhoneNumber</code> API, not the Amazon Connect admin website.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After releasing a phone number, the phone number enters into a cooldown
 * period for up to 180 days. It cannot be searched for or claimed again until
 * the period has ended. If you accidentally release a phone number, contact
 * Amazon Web Services Support.
 * </p>
 * </important>
 * <p>
 * If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently, contact us for a service
 * quota exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming
 * and releasing any more numbers until up to 180 days past the oldest number
 * released has expired.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number of
 * active phone numbers. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or
 * API during a rolling 180 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number
 * service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers until
 * 180 days past the oldest number released has expired.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level quota
 * of 99 phone numbers, and in any 180 day period you release 99, claim 99, and
 * then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At that point you are
 * blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open an Amazon Web Services
 * support ticket.
