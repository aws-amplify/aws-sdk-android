/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Connect asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that makes it easy to
 * set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer
 * engagement at any scale.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Connect provides rich metrics and real-time reporting that allow you
 * to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more
 * efficiently by putting customers in touch with the right agents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can
 * create and limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For
 * more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html"
 * >Amazon Connect Service Quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. For a
 * list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see <a
