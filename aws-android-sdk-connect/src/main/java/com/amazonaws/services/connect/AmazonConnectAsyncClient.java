/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Connect asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set
 * up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer
 * engagement at any scale.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to
 * optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more
 * efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can
 * create. There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make per
 * second. For more information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html"
 * >Amazon Connect Service Quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can connect programmatically to an AWS service by using an endpoint. For
 * a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html"
 * >Amazon Connect Endpoints</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
