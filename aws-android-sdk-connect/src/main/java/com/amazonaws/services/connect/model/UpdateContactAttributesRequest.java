/**
 * <p>
 * Creates or updates the contact attributes associated with the specified
 * contact.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can add or update attributes for both ongoing and completed contacts. For
 * example, you can update the customer's name or the reason the customer called
 * while the call is active, or add notes about steps that the agent took during
 * the call that are displayed to the next agent that takes the call. You can
 * also update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and
 * save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls
 * for additional analysis, such as legal review or identifying abusive callers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are
 * then deleted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b> You cannot use the operation to update attributes for
 * contacts that occurred prior to the release of the API, September 12, 2018.
 * You can update attributes only for contacts that started after the release of
 * the API. If you attempt to update attributes for a contact that occurred
 * prior to the release of the API, a 400 error is returned. This applies also
 * to queued callbacks that were initiated prior to the release of the API but
 * are still active in your instance.
