After Application Auto Scaling successfully scales out using a step scaling policy, it starts to calculate the cooldown time. While the cooldown period is in effect, capacity added by the initiating scale-out activity is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale-out activity. For example, when an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to increase the capacity by 2, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown period starts. If the alarm triggers again during the cooldown period but at a more aggressive step adjustment of 3, the previous increase of 2 is considered part of the current capacity. Therefore, only 1 is added to the capacity.</p> <p>With scale-in policies, the intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your applicationâ€™s availability, so scale-in activities are blocked until the cooldown period has expired. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out activity during the cooldown period after a scale-in activity, Application Auto Scaling scales out the target immediately. In this case, the cooldown period for the scale-in activity stops and doesn't complete.</p> <p>Application Auto Scaling provides a default value of 300 for the following scalable targets:</p> <ul> <li> <p>ECS services</p> </li> <li> <p>Spot Fleet requests</p> </li> <li> <p>EMR clusters</p> </li> <li> <p>AppStream 2.0 fleets</p> </li> <li> <p>Aurora DB clusters</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants</p> </li> <li> <p>Custom resources</p> </li> </ul> <p>For all other scalable targets, the default value is 0:</p> <ul> <li> <p>DynamoDB tables</p> </li> <li> <p>DynamoDB global secondary indexes</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Comprehend document classification endpoints</p> </li> <li> <p>Lambda provisioned concurrency</p> </li> <li> <p>Amazon Keyspaces tables</p> </li> </ul>
