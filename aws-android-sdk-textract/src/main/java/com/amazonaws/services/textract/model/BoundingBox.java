 * (y-coordinate) are coordinates that represent the top and left sides of the
 * bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin
 * (0,0).
 * </p>

 * The <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> values returned are ratios of the

 * the API returns a <code>left</code> value of 0.5 (350/700) and a

 * </p>

 * The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values represent the
 * dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page
 * dimension. For example, if the document page size is 700 x 200 pixels, and
