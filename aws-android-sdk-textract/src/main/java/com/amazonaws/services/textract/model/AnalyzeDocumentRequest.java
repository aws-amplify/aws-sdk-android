/**
 * <p>
 * Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The types of information returned are as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two
 * <a>Block</a> objects, each of type <code>KEY_VALUE_SET</code>: a KEY
 * <code>Block</code> object and a VALUE <code>Block</code> object. For example,
 * <i>Name: Ana Silva Carolina</i> contains a key and value. <i>Name:</i> is the
 * key. <i>Ana Silva Carolina</i> is the value.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Table and table cell data. A TABLE <code>Block</code> object contains
 * information about a detected table. A CELL <code>Block</code> object is
 * returned for each cell in a table.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Lines and words of text. A LINE <code>Block</code> object contains one or
 * more WORD <code>Block</code> objects. All lines and words that are detected
 * in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship
 * with the value of <code>FeatureTypes</code>).
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can
 * be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT
 * <code>Block</code> object contains information about a selection element,
 * including the selection status.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the
 * <code>FeatureTypes</code> list.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The output is returned in a list of <code>Block</code> objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>AnalyzeDocument</code> is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents
 * asynchronously, use <a>StartDocumentAnalysis</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
