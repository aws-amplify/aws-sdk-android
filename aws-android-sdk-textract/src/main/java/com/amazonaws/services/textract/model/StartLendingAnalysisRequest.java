/**
 * <p>
 * Starts the classification and analysis of an input document.
 * <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> initiates the classification and analysis
 * of a packet of lending documents. <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> operates
 * on a document file located in an Amazon S3 bucket.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> can analyze text in documents that are in
 * one of the following formats: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PDF. Use
 * <code>DocumentLocation</code> to specify the bucket name and the file name of
 * the document.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>StartLendingAnalysis</code> returns a job identifier (
 * <code>JobId</code>) that you use to get the results of the operation. When
 * the text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status
 * to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify
 * in <code>NotificationChannel</code>. To get the results of the text analysis
 * operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS
 * topic is SUCCEEDED. If the status is SUCCEEDED you can call either
 * <code>GetLendingAnalysis</code> or <code>GetLendingAnalysisSummary</code> and
 * provide the <code>JobId</code> to obtain the results of the analysis.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If using <code>OutputConfig</code> to specify an Amazon S3 bucket, the output
 * will be contained within the specified prefix in a directory labeled with the
 * job-id. In the directory there are 3 sub-directories:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * detailedResponse (contains the GetLendingAnalysis response)
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
