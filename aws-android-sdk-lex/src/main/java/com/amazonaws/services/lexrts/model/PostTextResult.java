     * <p>
     * For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a pizza"). If
     * Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this utterance, it will
     * return this dialogState.
     * </p>

     * <p>
     * <code>ConfirmIntent</code> - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no"

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an
     * intent.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Instead of a simple "yes" or "no," a user might respond with additional
     * information. For example, "yes, but make it thick crust pizza" or
     * "no, I want to order a drink". Amazon Lex can process such additional
     * information (in these examples, update the crust type slot value, or

     * <code>ElicitSlot</code> - Amazon Lex is expecting a slot value for the
     * current intent.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message:
     * "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply with the slot value
     * (e.g., "medium"). The user might also provide additional information in
     * the response (e.g., "medium thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process
     * such additional information appropriately.

     * <p>
     * <code>Fulfilled</code> - Conveys that the Lambda function configured for
     * the intent has successfully fulfilled the intent.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ReadyForFulfillment</code> - Conveys that the client has to fulfill
     * the intent.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>Failed</code> - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.
