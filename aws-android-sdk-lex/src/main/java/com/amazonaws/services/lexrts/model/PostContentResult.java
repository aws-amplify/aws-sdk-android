     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ElicitIntent</code> - Amazon Lex wants to elicit the user's intent.
     * Consider the following examples:
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a pizza"). If
     * Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this utterance, it will
     * return this dialog state.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ConfirmIntent</code> - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no"
     * response.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an
     * intent. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no" response, a user might respond
     * with additional information. For example,
     * "yes, but make it a thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink."
     * Amazon Lex can process such additional information (in these examples,
     * update the crust type slot or change the intent from OrderPizza to
     * OrderDrink).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ElicitSlot</code> - Amazon Lex is expecting the value of a slot for
     * the current intent.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message:
     * "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply with the slot value
     * (e.g., "medium"). The user might also provide additional information in
     * the response (e.g., "medium thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process
     * such additional information appropriately.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>Fulfilled</code> - Conveys that the Lambda function has
     * successfully fulfilled the intent.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>ReadyForFulfillment</code> - Conveys that the client has to fulfill
     * the request.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>Failed</code> - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.

     * <p>

     * provide an appropriate response to prompts from the service (you can
