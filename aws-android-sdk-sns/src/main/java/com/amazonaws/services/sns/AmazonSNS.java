/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Simple Notification Service <fullname>Amazon
 * Simple Notification Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables
 * you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use
 * Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested
 * subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this
 * product see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">http://aws.amazon.com/sns</a>. For detailed
 * information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/">Amazon SNS Developer
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred
 * programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes
 * care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests,
 * retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available
 * SDKs, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 * Services</a>.
