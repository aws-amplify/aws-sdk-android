     * <code>MonthlySpendLimit</code> – The maximum amount in USD that you are
     * willing to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS
     * determines that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds
     * this limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.
     * </p>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit being
     * crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you
     * will incur costs that exceed your limit.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * <code>DeliveryStatusIAMRole</code> – The ARN of the IAM role that allows
     * Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For
     * each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the
     * message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if
     * the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate</code> – The percentage of
     * successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in
     * CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example,
     * to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to
     * <code>0</code>. To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set
     * it to <code>10</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>DefaultSenderID</code> – A string, such as your business brand,
     * that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for
     * sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric
     * characters, and it must contain at least one letter.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>DefaultSMSType</code> – The type of SMS message that you will send
     * by default. You can assign the following values:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>Promotional</code> – Noncritical messages, such as marketing
     * messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest
     * cost.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>Transactional</code> – (Default) Critical messages that support
     * customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor
     * authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve the
     * highest reliability.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <code>UsageReportS3Bucket</code> – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to
     * receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS
     * will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report
     * includes the following information for each SMS message that was
     * successfully delivered by your account:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Time that the message was published (in UTC)
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Message ID
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Destination phone number
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Message type
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Delivery status
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Message price (in USD)
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too long for
     * a single message)
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Total number of parts
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the
     * Amazon SNS service principle to perform the <code>s3:PutObject</code> and
     * <code>s3:GetBucketLocation</code> actions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For an example bucket policy and usage report, see <a
