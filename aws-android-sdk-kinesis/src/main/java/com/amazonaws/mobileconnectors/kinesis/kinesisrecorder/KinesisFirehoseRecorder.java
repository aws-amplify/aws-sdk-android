/**
 * The {@link KinesisFirehoseRecorder} is a high level client for Amazon Kinesis
 * Firehose. It can cache data on users' Android device and send them in a batch
 * later.
 * <p/>
 * Note: {@link KinesisFirehoseRecorder#submitAllRecords()} is a synchronous
 * method that sends cached data to Amazon Kinesis over the network. Therefore
 * you should not call KinesisRecorder methods on the main thread.
 * <p/>
 * Warning: You should not create multiple {@link KinesisFirehoseRecorder} given
 * the same directory. Doing so is an error and behavior is undefined.
 * <p/>
 * Note: {@link KinesisFirehoseRecorder} stores the requests in plain-text, and
 * does not perform additional security measures outside of what the Android OS
 * offers by default. Therefore it is recommended you pass a directory that is
 * only visible to your application, and additionally do not store highly
 * sensitive information using {@link KinesisFirehoseRecorder}.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // working directory for the recorder
 * File directory = context.getCachedDir();
 * // AWS Firehose region
 * Regions region = Regions.US_WEST_2;
 * // initialize a credentials provider
 * AWSCredentialsProvider provider = new CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider(
 *         context,
 *         &quot;identityPoolId&quot;,
 *         Regions.US_EAST_1);
 * KinesisFirehoseRecorder firehoseRecorder = new KinesisFirehoseRecorder(
 *         directory, region, provider);
 * // save some strings
 * String streamName = &quot;my_stream&quot;; // Firehose delivery stream name
 * firehoseRecorder.saveRecord(&quot;Hello world!\n&quot;, streamName);
 * firehoseRecorder.saveRecord(&quot;Streaming data to S3 via Firehose is easy.\n&quot;, streamName);
 * 
 * // send previously save data to Amazon Firehose
 * // Note: submitAllRecords() makes network calls, so wrap it in an AsyncTask.
 * new AsyncTask&lt;Void, Void, Void&gt;() {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     protected Void doInBackground(Void... v) {
 *         try {
 *             firehoseRecorder.submitAllRecords();
 *         } catch (AmazonClientException ace) {
 *             // error occurs.
 *         }
 *     }
 * }.execute();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * {@link KinesisFirehoseRecorder} requires an IAM policy that allows
 * PutRecordBatch action on the target delivery stream. Here is an example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "Version": "2012-10-17",
 *   "Statement": [{
 *     "Effect": "Allow",
 *     "Action": [ "firehose:PutRecordBatch" ],
 *     "Resource": [
 *       "arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:123456789012:deliverystream/my_stream"
 *     ]
 *   }]
 * }
 * </pre>
