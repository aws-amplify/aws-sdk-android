/**
 * The KinesisRecorder is a high level client meant for storing records on the
 * users Android device. This allows developers to retain requests when the
 * device is offline. It can also increase performance and battery efficiency
 * since the wi-fi or cell network does not need to be woken up as frequently.
 * <p/>
 * Note: KinesisRecorder uses all synchronous calls regardless of the
 * AmazonKinesisClient passed in. Therefore you should not call KinesisRecorder
 * methods on the main thread.
 * <p/>
 * To use KinesisRecorder create an AmazonKinesisClient and an directory that is
 * private to your application. The directory passed should be empty the first
 * time you instantiate KinesisRecorder, and should only be used for
 * KinesisRecorder to prevent collision. Additionally you may pass an instance
 * of KinesisRecorderConfig in order to set parameters on KinesisRecorder (Such
 * as the maximum amount of storage KinesisRecorder may use).
 * <p/>
 * Warning: You should not create multiple KinesisRecorders given the same
 * directory. Doing so is an error and behavior is undefined.
 * <p/>
 * Note: KinesisRecorder stores the requests in plain-text, and does not perform
 * additional security measures outside of what the Android OS offers by
 * default. Therefore it is recommended you pass a directory that is only
 * visible to your application, and additionally do not store highly sensitive
 * information using Kinesis Recorder.
 * <p/>
 * KinesisRecorder requires an IAM policy that allows PutRecords action on the
 * target stream. Here is an example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "Version": "2012-10-17",
 *   "Statement": [{
 *     "Effect": "Allow",
 *     "Action": [ "kinesis:PutRecords" ],
 *     "Resource": [
 *       "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:123456789012:stream/my_stream"
 *     ]
 *   }]
 * }
 * </pre>
