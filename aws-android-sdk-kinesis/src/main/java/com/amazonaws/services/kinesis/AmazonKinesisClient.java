     * means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in
     * a stream.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed
     * of. Each shard can support reads up to 5 transactions per second, up to a
     * maximum data read total of 2 MB per second. Each shard can support writes
     * up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB
     * per second. You can add shards to a stream if the amount of data input
     * increases and you can remove shards if the amount of data input
     * decreases.

     * >Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer
     * Guide</i>). Your application should have one thread per shard, each
     * reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually,
     * call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the
     * shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call.
     * <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in
     * <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the shard iterator returned in
     * <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to <a>GetRecords</a>.
     * Note that if the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return
     * more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in
     * <code>NextShardIterator</code>. You can terminate the loop when the shard
     * is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the
     * sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to
     * process.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Each data record can be up to 1 MB in size, and each shard can read up to
     * 2 MB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum
     * supported size or throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to
     * specify the maximum number of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return.
     * Consider your average record size when determining this limit.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on
     * the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that
     * <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MB. If a call returns this amount of
     * data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw
     * <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is
     * insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard, subsequent calls made
     * within the next 1 second throw
     * <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. Note that
     * <a>GetRecords</a> won't return any data when it throws an exception. For
     * this reason, we recommend that you wait one second between calls to
     * <a>GetRecords</a>; however, it's possible that the application will get
     * exceptions for longer than 1 second.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you
     * can use the <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can
     * also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms
     * (see <a

     * the most recent data in the shard.
     * </p>

     * When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a <a>GetShardIterator</a>

     * read data from the stream for real-time processing.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the
