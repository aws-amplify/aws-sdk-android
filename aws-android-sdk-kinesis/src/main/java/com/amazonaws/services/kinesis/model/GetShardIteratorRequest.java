/**
 * <p>
 * Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires five minutes
 * after it is returned to the requester.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading
 * data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence
 * number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier
 * associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a
 * record is put into the stream. Each stream has one or more shards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the
 * <code>ShardIteratorType</code> parameter to read exactly from the position
 * denoted by a specific sequence number by using the
 * <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type, or right after the
 * sequence number by using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard
 * iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to
 * <a>PutRecord</a>, <a>PutRecords</a>, <a>GetRecords</a>, or
 * <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request, you can specify the shard iterator
 * type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from an arbitrary point in
 * time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause <code>ShardIterator</code> to point
 * to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data
 * record in the shard), or <code>LATEST</code> so that you always read the most
 * recent data in the shard.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request
 * to get the first shard iterator for use in your first <a>GetRecords</a>
 * request and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned by the
 * <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. A new shard
 * iterator is returned by every <a>GetRecords</a> request in
 * <code>NextShardIterator</code>, which you use in the
 * <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <a>GetRecords</a> request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request is made too often, you receive a
 * <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. For more information
 * about throughput limits, see <a>GetRecords</a>, and <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html"
 * >Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the shard is closed, <a>GetShardIterator</a> returns a valid iterator for
 * the last sequence number of the shard. Note that a shard can be closed as a
 * result of using <a>SplitShard</a> or <a>MergeShards</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetShardIterator</a> has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account
 * per open shard.
