/**
 * <p>
 * Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis stream. Call
 * <code>PutRecord</code> to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion
 * and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support
 * writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1
 * MB per second.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports
 * the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log
 * file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis to distribute data across shards.
 * Amazon Kinesis segregates the data records that belong to a stream into
 * multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to
 * determine which shard a given data record belongs to.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256
 * characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys
 * to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using
 * the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key
 * to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the
 * <code>ExplicitHashKey</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream"
 * >Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>PutRecord</code> returns the shard ID of where the data record was
 * placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a
 * stream, not across all shards within a stream. To guarantee strictly
 * increasing ordering, write serially to a shard and use the
 * <code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code> parameter. For more information, see
 * <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream"
 * >Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer
 * Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a <code>PutRecord</code> request cannot be processed because of
 * insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request,
 * <code>PutRecord</code> throws
 * <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Data records are accessible for only 24 hours from the time that they are
 * added to a stream.
