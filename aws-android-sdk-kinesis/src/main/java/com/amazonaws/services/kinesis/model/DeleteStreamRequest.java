 * <p>
 * Deletes an Amazon Kinesis stream and all its shards and data. You must shut
 * down any applications that are operating on the stream before you delete the
 * stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream, it will
 * receive the exception <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the stream is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state, you can delete it. After a
 * <code>DeleteStream</code> request, the specified stream is in the
 * <code>DELETING</code> state until Amazon Kinesis completes the deletion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Amazon Kinesis might continue to accept data read and write
 * operations, such as <a>PutRecord</a>, <a>PutRecords</a>, and
 * <a>GetRecords</a>, on a stream in the <code>DELETING</code> state until the
 * stream deletion is complete.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted, and any
 * tags are dissociated from the stream.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the <a>DescribeStream</a> operation to check the state of the
 * stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.
