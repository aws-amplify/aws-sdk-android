     * Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call,
     * which can achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing single
     * records. To write single data records into a delivery stream, use
     * <a>PutRecord</a>. Applications using these operations are referred to as
     * producers.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request supports up to 500 records. Each
     * record in the request can be as large as 1,000 KB (before 64-bit
     * encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB for the entire request. By default, each
     * delivery stream can take in up to 2,000 transactions per second, 5,000
     * records per second, or 5 MB per second. Note that if you use
     * <a>PutRecord</a> and <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, the limits are an aggregate
     * across these two operations for each delivery stream. For more
     * information about limits and how to request an increase, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html">Amazon
     * Kinesis Firehose Limits</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when
     * using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can
     * be up to 1,000 KB in size, and any kind of data, for example, a segment
     * from a log file, geographic location data, web site clickstream data, and
     * so on.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To
     * disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to
     * use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (<code>\n</code>) or some
     * other character unique within the data. This allows the consumer
     * application(s) to parse individual data items when reading the data from
     * the destination.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <a>PutRecordBatch</a> response includes a count of any failed
     * records, <b>FailedPutCount</b>, and an array of responses,
     * <b>RequestResponses</b>. The <b>FailedPutCount</b> value is a count of
     * records that failed. Each entry in the <b>RequestResponses</b> array
     * gives additional information of the processed record. Each entry in
     * <b>RequestResponses</b> directly correlates with a record in the request
     * array using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request
     * and response. <b>RequestResponses</b> always includes the same number of
     * records as the request array. <b>RequestResponses</b> both successfully
     * and unsuccessfully processed records. Firehose attempts to process all
     * records in each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request. A single record failure
     * does not stop the processing of subsequent records.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A successfully processed record includes a <b>RecordId</b> value, which
     * is a unique value identified for the record. An unsuccessfully processed
     * record includes <b>ErrorCode</b> and <b>ErrorMessage</b> values.
     * <b>ErrorCode</b> reflects the type of error and is one of the following
     * values: <code>ServiceUnavailable</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>.
     * <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the
     * error.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If <b>FailedPutCount</b> is greater than 0 (zero), retry the request. A
     * retry of the entire batch of records is possible; however, we strongly
     * recommend that you inspect the entire response and resend only those
     * records that failed processing. This minimizes duplicate records and also
     * reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the <a>PutRecordBatch</a> operation throws a
     * <b>ServiceUnavailableException</b>, back off and retry. If the exception
     * persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded
     * for the delivery stream.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Data records sent to Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they
     * are added to a delivery stream as it attempts to send the records to the
     * destination. If the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours,
