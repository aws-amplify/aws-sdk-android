     * <p>
     * Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call,
     * which can achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing single
     * records. To write single data records into a delivery stream, use
     * <a>PutRecord</a>. Applications using these operations are referred to as
     * producers.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * By default, each delivery stream can take in up to 2,000 transactions per
     * second, 5,000 records per second, or 5 MB per second. If you use
     * <a>PutRecord</a> and <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, the limits are an aggregate
     * across these two operations for each delivery stream. For more
     * information about limits, see <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html">Amazon
     * Kinesis Data Firehose Limits</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request supports up to 500 records. Each
     * record in the request can be as large as 1,000 KB (before 64-bit
     * encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB for the entire request. These limits
     * cannot be changed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when
     * using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can
     * be up to 1,000 KB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it could be
     * a segment from a log file, geographic location data, website clickstream
     * data, and so on.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the
     * destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common
     * solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (
     * <code>\n</code>) or some other character unique within the data. This
     * allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when
     * reading the data from the destination.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <a>PutRecordBatch</a> response includes a count of failed records,
     * <code>FailedPutCount</code>, and an array of responses,
     * <code>RequestResponses</code>. Even if the <a>PutRecordBatch</a> call
     * succeeds, the value of <code>FailedPutCount</code> may be greater than 0,
     * indicating that there are records for which the operation didn't succeed.
     * Each entry in the <code>RequestResponses</code> array provides additional
     * information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a
     * record in the request array using the same ordering, from the top to the
     * bottom. The response array always includes the same number of records as
     * the request array. <code>RequestResponses</code> includes both
     * successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Firehose
     * tries to process all records in each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request. A
     * single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A successfully processed record includes a <code>RecordId</code> value,
     * which is unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record
     * includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values.
     * <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error, and is one of the
     * following values: <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code> or
     * <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more
     * detailed information about the error.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have
     * completed or it might have failed. If <code>FailedPutCount</code> is
     * greater than 0, retry the request, resending only those records that
     * might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate
     * records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding
     * charges). We recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If <a>PutRecordBatch</a> throws <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>,
     * back off and retry. If the exception persists, it is possible that the
     * throughput limits have been exceeded for the delivery stream.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from
     * the time they are added to a delivery stream as it attempts to send the
     * records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more
     * than 24 hours, the data is no longer available.
     * </p>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of
     * your records. Instead, concatenate the raw data, then perform base64
