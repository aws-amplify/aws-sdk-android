/**
 * Represents one or more Amazon S3 objects involved in an AWS access control
 * policy. S3 object resources can be fully specified (i.e. the full key) or you
 * can use the '*' wildcard to match multiple objects.
 * <p>
 * For example, an object resource created for bucket 'mybucket' and key pattern
 * 'foo*' will match any object stored in 'mybucket' with a key that starts with
 * 'foo':
 *
 * <pre class="brush: java">
 * new S3ObjectResource(&quot;mybucket&quot;, &quot;foo*&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * To match all objects in a bucket:
 *
 * <pre class="brush: java">
 * new S3ObjectResource(&quot;mybucket&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Amazon S3 object resources can be used in the following operations:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link S3Actions#GetObject}
 * <li> {@link S3Actions#GetObjectVersion}
 * <li> {@link S3Actions#PutObject}
 * <li> {@link S3Actions#GetObjectAcl}
