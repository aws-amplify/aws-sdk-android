/**
 * <p>
 * Represents an Amazon S3 bucket.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Every object stored in Amazon S3 is contained within a bucket. Buckets
 * partition the namespace of objects stored in Amazon S3 at the top level.
 * Within a bucket, any name can be used for objects. However, bucket names must
 * be unique across all of Amazon S3.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Bucket ownership is similar to the ownership of Internet domain names. Within
 * Amazon S3, only a single user owns each bucket. Once a uniquely named bucket
 * is created in Amazon S3, organize and name the objects within the bucket in
 * any way. Ownership of the bucket is retained as long as the owner has an
 * Amazon S3 account.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To conform with DNS requirements, the following constraints apply:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bucket names should not contain underscores</li>
 * <li>Bucket names should be between 3 and 63 characters long</li>
 * <li>Bucket names should not end with a dash</li>
 * <li>Bucket names cannot contain adjacent periods</li>
 * <li>Bucket names cannot contain dashes next to periods (e.g.,
 * "my-.bucket.com" and "my.-bucket" are invalid)</li>
 * <li>Bucket names cannot contain uppercase characters</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are no limits to the number of objects that can be stored in a bucket.
 * Performance does not vary based on the number of buckets used. Store all
 * objects within a single bucket or organize them across several buckets.
 * </p>
