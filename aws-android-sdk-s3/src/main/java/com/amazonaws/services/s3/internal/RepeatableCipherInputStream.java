/**

 * original data.
 * <p>
 * It's repeatable if and only if the underlying unencryptedDataStream is
 * repeatable - if the underlying input stream is not repeatable and you're
 * going to buffer to make it repeatable anyways, it makes more sense to do so
 * after wrapping in this object, so we buffer the encrypted data and don't have
 * to bother re-encrypting on retry.
 * <p>
 * This stream <em>only</em> supports being marked before the first call to
 * {@code read} or {@code skip}, since it's not possible to rewind the
 * encryption state of a {@code CipherInputStream} to an arbitrary point. If you
 * call {@code mark} after calling {@code read} or {@code skip}, it will throw
