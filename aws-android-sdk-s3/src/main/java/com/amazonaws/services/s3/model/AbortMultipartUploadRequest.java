/**
 * <p>
 * This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is
 * aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The
 * storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if
 * any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might
 * not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart
 * upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all
 * parts.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the
 * part storage, you should call the <a>ListParts</a> operation and ensure that
 * the parts list is empty.
