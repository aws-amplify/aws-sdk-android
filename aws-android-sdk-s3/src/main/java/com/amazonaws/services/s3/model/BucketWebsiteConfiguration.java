/**
 * Bucket configuration options for hosting static websites entirely out of
 * Amazon S3.
 * <p>
 * To host a static website in Amazon S3, create a bucket, upload your files,
 * and set the bucket website configuration. Once your bucket has been
 * configured as a website, you can access all your content via the Amazon S3
 * website endpoint. To ensure that the existing Amazon S3 REST API will
 * continue to behave the same, regardless of whether or not your bucket has
 * been configured to host a website, a new HTTP endpoint has been introduced
 * where you can access your website content. The bucket content you want to
 * make available via the website must be publicly readable.
 * <p>
 * To enable hosting websites, Amazon S3 introduces the following
 * concepts/features:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Website endpoints</b> - When you configure a bucket as a website, the
 * website is available via the the region-specific website endpoint where the
 * bucket resides.
 * <li><b>Index document support</b> - When configuring a bucket as a website
 * you must provide an index document name. This is the webpage that Amazon S3
 * returns when it receives a request to the root of your website, or one of its
 * subdirectories. Amazon S3 supports index documents in subdirectories.
 * <li><b>Error document support</b> - Should an error occur, Amazon S3 will
 * return an HTML error document, instead of an XML document.You can optionally
 * provide your own error document that contains HTML, or any other static
 * content specific to your website. You provide the error document name when
 * you configure a bucket as a website. If you provide the custom error
 * document, Amazon S3 returns your custom error document when an HTTP 4XX class
 * error occurs. For other error non-4XX class errors, Amazon S3 will return its
 * own error document.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For more information on how to host a website on Amazon S3, see: <a href=
 * "http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html"
 * >http
 * ://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html</a>.
