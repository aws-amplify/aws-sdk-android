 * The Amazon S3 Java SDK provides a simple interface that can be used to store

 * pass those benefits on to developers.

     * <p>
     * Returns a list of summary information about the versions in the specified
     * bucket.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The returned version summaries are ordered first by key and then by
     * version. Keys are sorted lexicographically (alphabetically) and versions
     * are sorted from most recent to least recent. Versions with data and
     * delete markers are included in the results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Because buckets can contain a virtually unlimited number of versions, the
     * complete results of a list query can be extremely large. To manage large
     * result sets, Amazon S3 uses pagination to split them into multiple
     * responses. Always check the {@link VersionListing#isTruncated()} method
     * to determine if the returned listing is complete or if additional calls
     * are needed to get more results. Callers are encouraged to use
     * {@link AmazonS3#listNextBatchOfVersions(VersionListing)} as an easy way
     * to get the next page of results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>keyMarker</code> and <code>versionIdMarker</code> parameters
     * allow callers to specify where to start the version listing.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>delimiter</code> parameter allows groups of keys that share a
     * delimiter-terminated prefix to be included in the returned listing. This
     * allows applications to organize and browse their keys hierarchically,
     * much like how a file system organizes files into directories. These
     * common prefixes can be retrieved by calling the
     * {@link VersionListing#getCommonPrefixes()} method.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, consider a bucket that contains the following keys:
     * <ul>
     * <li>"foo/bar/baz"</li>
     * <li>"foo/bar/bash"</li>
     * <li>"foo/bar/bang"</li>
     * <li>"foo/boo"</li>
     * </ul>
     * If calling <code>listVersions</code> with a <code>prefix</code> value of
     * "foo/" and a <code>delimiter</code> value of "/" on this bucket, a
     * <code>VersionListing</code> is returned that contains:
     * <ul>
     * <li>all the versions for one key ("foo/boo")</li>
     * <li>one entry in the common prefixes list ("foo/bar/")</li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To see deeper into the virtual hierarchy, make another call to
     * <code>listVersions</code> setting the prefix parameter to any interesting
     * common prefix to list the individual versions under that prefix.
     * </p>

     *
     * @param bucketName The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose versions are to
     *            be listed.
     * @param prefix An optional parameter restricting the response to keys that
     *            begin with the specified prefix. Use prefixes to separate a
     *            bucket into different sets of keys, similar to how a file
     *            system organizes files into directories.
     * @param keyMarker Optional parameter indicating where in the sorted list
     *            of all versions in the specified bucket to begin returning
     *            results. Results are always ordered first lexicographically
     *            (i.e. alphabetically) and then from most recent version to
     *            least recent version. If a keyMarker is used without a
     *            versionIdMarker, results begin immediately after that key's
     *            last version. When a keyMarker is used with a versionIdMarker,
     *            results begin immediately after the version with the specified
     *            key and version ID.
     *            <p>
     *            This enables pagination; to get the next page of results use

     *            convenience method
     *            {@link AmazonS3#listNextBatchOfVersions(VersionListing)}
     * @param versionIdMarker Optional parameter indicating where in the sorted
     *            list of all versions in the specified bucket to begin
     *            returning results. Results are always ordered first
     *            lexicographically (i.e. alphabetically) and then from most
     *            recent version to least recent version. A keyMarker must be
     *            specified when specifying a versionIdMarker. Results begin
     *            immediately after the version with the specified key and
     *            version ID.
     *            <p>

     *            convenience method
     *            {@link AmazonS3#listNextBatchOfVersions(VersionListing)}
     * @param delimiter Optional parameter that causes keys that contain the
     *            same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the
     *            delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the
     *            {@link VersionListing#getCommonPrefixes()} list. These
     *            rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. The
     *            most commonly used delimiter is "/", which simulates a
     *            hierarchical organization similar to a file system directory
     *            structure.
     * @param maxResults Optional parameter indicating the maximum number of
     *            results to include in the response. Amazon S3 might return
     *            fewer than this, but will not return more. Even if maxKeys is
     *            not specified, Amazon S3 will limit the number of results in
     *            the response.
     * @return A listing of the versions in the specified bucket, along with any
     *         other associated information such as common prefixes (if a
     *         delimiter was specified), the original request parameters, etc.

     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Be careful to set the correct content type in the metadata object
     * before directly sending a stream. Unlike file uploads, content types from
     * input streams cannot be automatically determined. If the caller doesn't
     * explicitly set the content type, it will not be set in Amazon S3.</li>
     * <li>Content length <b>must</b> be specified before data can be uploaded
     * to Amazon S3. Amazon S3 explicitly requires that the content length be
     * sent in the request headers before it will accept any of the data. If the
     * caller doesn't provide the length, the library must buffer the contents
     * of the input stream in order to calculate it.

     * If versioning is enabled for the specified bucket, this operation will
     * never overwrite an existing object with the same key, but will keep the
     * existing object as an older version until that version is explicitly
     * deleted (see {@link AmazonS3#deleteVersion(String, String, String)}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If versioning is not enabled, this operation will overwrite an existing

     * Amazon S3 does not provide object locking. If Amazon S3 receives multiple
     * write requests for the same object nearly simultaneously, all of the

     * Returns a pre-signed URL for accessing an Amazon S3 resource.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Pre-signed URLs allow clients to form a URL for an Amazon S3 resource,
     * and then sign it with the current AWS security credentials. The
     * pre-signed URL can be shared to other users, allowing access to the
     * resource without providing an account's AWS security credentials.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Pre-signed URLs are useful in many situations where AWS security
     * credentials aren't available from the client that needs to make the
     * actual request to Amazon S3.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, an application may need remote users to upload files to the
     * application owner's Amazon S3 bucket, but doesn't need to ship the AWS
     * security credentials with the application. A pre-signed URL to PUT an
     * object into the owner's bucket can be generated from a remote location
     * with the owner's AWS security credentials, then the pre-signed URL can be
     * passed to the end user's application to use.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that presigned URLs cannot be used to upload an object with an
     * attached policy, as described in <a href=
     * "https://aws.amazon.com/articles/1434?_encoding=UTF8&queryArg=searchQuery&x=0&fromSearch=1&y=0&searchPath=all"
     * >this blog post</a>. That method is only suitable for POSTs from HTML
