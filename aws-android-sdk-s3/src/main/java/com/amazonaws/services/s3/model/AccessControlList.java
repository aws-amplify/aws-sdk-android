/**
 * <p>
 * Represents an Amazon S3 Access Control List (ACL), including the ACL's set of
 * grantees and the permissions assigned to each grantee.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access
 * control policy. When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request
 * using its standard authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify
 * the sender was granted access to the bucket or object. If the sender is
 * approved, the request proceeds. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An ACL contains a list of grants. Each grant consists of one grantee and one
 * permission. ACLs only grant permissions; they do not deny them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For convenience, some commonly used ACLs are defined in
 * {@link CannedAccessControlList}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Bucket and object ACLs are completely independent; an object does not
 * inherit an ACL from its bucket. For example, if you create a bucket and grant
 * write access to another user, you will not be able to access the user's
 * objects unless the user explicitly grants access. This also applies if you
 * grant anonymous write access to a bucket. Only the user "anonymous" will be
 * able to access objects the user created unless permission is explicitly
 * granted to the bucket owner.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Important: Do not grant the anonymous group write access to buckets, as you
 * will have no control over the objects others can store and their associated
 * charges.
 * </p>
