/**
 * Represents a customer provided key for use with Amazon S3 server-side
 * encryption.
 *
 * Server-side encryption is about data encryption at rest, that is, Amazon S3
 * encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts
 * it for you when you access it. Amazon S3 manages encryption and decryption
 * for you.
 *
 * This class allows you to specify your own encryption key for Amazon S3 to use
 * when encrypting your data on the server-side, instead of allowing Amazon to
 * automatically generate an encryption key for you.
 *
 * For more information on Amazon S3 server-side encryption, see:
 * http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html
 *
 * This encryption is done entirely on the server-side.  Your data is transmitted
 * to Amazon S3 over a secure SSL connection and then encrypted when it reaches
 * Amazon's servers.  The SDK also offers client-side encryption, where the encryption
 * keys and unencrypted data never leave your machines.
 *
 * For more information on client-side encryption for Amazon S3 data, see:
 * http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html
