/**
 * Request object for the parameters to retrieve a bucket's website
 * configuration.
 * <p>
 * Bucket website configuration allows you to host your static websites entirely
 * out of Amazon S3. To host your website in Amazon S3, create a bucket, upload
 * your files, and configure it as a website. Once your bucket has been
 * configured as a website, you can access all your content via the Amazon S3
 * website endpoint. To ensure that the existing Amazon S3 REST API will
 * continue to behave the same, regardless of whether or not your bucket has
 * been configured to host a website, a new HTTP endpoint has been introduced
 * where you can access your content. The bucket content you want to make
 * available via the website must be publicly readable.
 * <p>
 * For more information on how to host a website on Amazon S3, see: <a href=
 * "http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html"
 * >http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.
 * html</a>.
 * <p>
 * This operation requires the <code>S3:GetBucketWebsite</code> permission. By
 * default, only the bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration.
 * However, bucket owners can allow other users to read the website
 * configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the
 * <code>S3:GetBucketWebsite</code> permission.
 *
 * @see AmazonS3#getBucketWebsiteConfiguration(GetBucketWebsiteConfigurationRequest)
