/**
 * Functions like a {@link Cipher} but provides only a subset of all the
 * interface methods of {@link Cipher}. This class is intended to be used in
 * lieu of the underlying Cipher directly whenever applicable. For example, this
 * class makes it easy to generate an inverse cipher, or to create an
 * "auxiliary" cipher for use with get-range or multi-part upload operations. A
 * subclass may also support the mark and reset operations to enable parts of a
 * plaintext to be re-processed which is useful for error recovery typical when
 * network transmission is involved.
 * <p>
 * However a cipher lite, unlike a {@link Cipher}, can only be used once, and
 * cannot be reused after the {@link #doFinal()} methods have been invoked. In
 * other words, it is NOT true that, upon finishing, the doFinal method will
 * reset the cipher lite object to the state it was in when first constructed.
