/**
 * Represents an e-mail grantee. An e-mail grantee is a grantee identified by
 * their e-mail address and authenticated by an Amazon system.
 * <p>
 * E-mail grants are internally converted to the canonical user representation
 * when creating the ACL. If the grantee changes their e-mail address, it will
 * not affect existing Amazon S3 permissions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Adding a grantee by e-mail address only works if exactly one Amazon account
 * corresponds to the specified e-mail address. If multiple Amazon accounts are
 * associated with the e-mail address, an <code>AmbiguousGrantByEmail</code>
 * error message is returned. This happens rarely, but usually occurs if a user
 * created an Amazon account in the past, forgotten the password, and created
 * another Amazon account using the same e-mail address. If this occurs, the
 * user should contact Amazon customer service to have the accounts merged.
 * Alernatively, grant user access specifying the canonical user representation.
 * </p>
