/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon SQS asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference</i>. This section
 * describes who should read this guide, how the guide is organized, and other
 * resources related to the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as
 * they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, you can move data between
 * distributed components of your applications that perform different tasks
 * without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.

 * <ul>

 * <p>
 * Cryptographically signing your service requests
