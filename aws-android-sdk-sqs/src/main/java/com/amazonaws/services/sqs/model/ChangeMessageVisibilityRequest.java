/**
 * <p>
 * Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new
 * value. The maximum allowed timeout value you can set the value to is 12
 * hours. This means you can't extend the timeout of a message in an existing
 * queue to more than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more
 * information visibility timeout, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html"
 * >Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, let's say you have a message and its default message visibility
 * timeout is 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call
 * <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a timeout of 10 minutes. At that
 * time, the timeout for the message would be extended by 10 minutes beyond the
 * time of the ChangeMessageVisibility call. This results in a total visibility
 * timeout of 13 minutes. You can continue to call ChangeMessageVisibility to
 * extend the visibility timeout to a maximum of 12 hours. If you try to extend
 * beyond 12 hours, the request will be rejected.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * There is a 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages per queue.
 * Messages are inflight after they have been received from the queue by a
 * consuming component, but have not yet been deleted from the queue. If you
 * reach the 120,000 limit, you will receive an OverLimit error message from
 * Amazon SQS. To help avoid reaching the limit, you should delete the messages
 * from the queue after they have been processed. You can also increase the
 * number of queues you use to process the messages.
 * </p>
 * </note> <important>
 * <p>
 * If you attempt to set the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> to an amount more
 * than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not
 * automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time
 * remaining.
 * </p>
 * </important> <important>
 * <p>
 * Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific
 * message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in memory
 * for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the
 * visibility timeout for the message the next time it is received reverts to
 * the original timeout value, not the value you set with the
 * <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action.
 * </p>
