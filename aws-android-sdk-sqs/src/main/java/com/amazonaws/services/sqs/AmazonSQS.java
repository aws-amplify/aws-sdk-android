/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon SQS
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference</i>. This section
 * describes who should read this guide, how the guide is organized, and other
 * resources related to the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as
 * they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, you can move data between
 * distributed components of your applications that perform different tasks
 * without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.

     * <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a timeout of 10 minutes. At that

     * >Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>.)
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, let's say you have a message and its default message
     * visibility timeout is 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call
     * <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a timeout of 10 minutes. At that
     * time, the timeout for the message would be extended by 10 minutes beyond
     * the time of the ChangeMessageVisibility call. This results in a total
     * visibility timeout of 13 minutes. You can continue to call
     * ChangeMessageVisibility to extend the visibility timeout to a maximum of
     * 12 hours. If you try to extend beyond 12 hours, the request will be
     * rejected.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * There is a 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages per queue.
     * Messages are inflight after they have been received from the queue by a
     * consuming component, but have not yet been deleted from the queue. If you
     * reach the 120,000 limit, you will receive an OverLimit error message from
     * Amazon SQS. To help avoid reaching the limit, you should delete the
     * messages from the queue after they have been processed. You can also
     * increase the number of queues you use to process the messages.
     * </p>
     * </note> <important>
     * <p>
     * If you attempt to set the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> to an amount
     * more than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not
     * automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time
     * remaining.
     * </p>
     * </important> <important>
     * <p>
     * Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a
     * specific message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not
     * saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it
     * is received, the visibility timeout for the message the next time it is
     * received reverts to the original timeout value, not the value you set
     * with the <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action.
