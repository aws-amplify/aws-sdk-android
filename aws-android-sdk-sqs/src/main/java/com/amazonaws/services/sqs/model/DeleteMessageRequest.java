/**
 * <p>
 * Deletes the specified message from the specified queue. You specify the
 * message by using the message's <code>receipt handle</code> and not the
 * <code>message ID</code> you received when you sent the message. Even if the
 * message is locked by another reader due to the visibility timeout setting, it
 * is still deleted from the queue. If you leave a message in the queue for
 * longer than the queue's configured retention period, Amazon SQS automatically
 * deletes it.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * The receipt handle is associated with a specific instance of receiving the
 * message. If you receive a message more than once, the receipt handle you get
 * each time you receive the message is different. When you request
 * <code>DeleteMessage</code>, if you don't provide the most recently received
 * receipt handle for the message, the request will still succeed, but the
 * message might not be deleted.
 * </p>
 * </note> <important>
 * <p>
 * It is possible you will receive a message even after you have deleted it.
 * This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers storing a copy of
 * the message is unavailable when you request to delete the message. The copy
 * remains on the server and might be returned to you again on a subsequent
 * receive request. You should create your system to be idempotent so that
 * receiving a particular message more than once is not a problem.
