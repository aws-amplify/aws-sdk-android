 * as the maximum number of threads used to retrieve the messages are

 * Synchronization strategy: - Threads must hold the TaskSpawnSyncPoint object
 * monitor to spawn a new task or modify the number of inflight tasks - Threads
 * must hold the monitor of the "futures" list to modify the list - Threads must
 * hold the monitor of the "finishedTasks" list to modify the list - If you need
