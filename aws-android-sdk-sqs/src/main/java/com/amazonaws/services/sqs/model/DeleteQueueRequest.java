/**
 * <p>
 * Deletes the queue specified by the <b>queue URL</b>, regardless of whether
 * the queue is empty. If the specified queue doesn't exist, Amazon SQS returns
 * a successful response.
 * </p>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * Use <code>DeleteQueue</code> with care; once you delete your queue, any
 * messages in the queue are no longer available.
 * </p>
 * </important>
 * <p>
 * When you delete a queue, the deletion process takes up to 60 seconds.
 * Requests you send involving that queue during the 60 seconds might succeed.
 * For example, a <a>SendMessage</a> request might succeed, but after the 60
 * seconds, the queue and that message you sent no longer exist. Also, when you
 * delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue
 * with the same name.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We reserve the right to delete queues that have had no activity for more than
 * 30 days. For more information, see <a href=
