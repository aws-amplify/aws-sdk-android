/**
 * <p>
 * Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in
 * the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the
 * operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not
 * currently exist that is owned by the caller's AWS account with the specified
 * creation token, this operation does the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS
 * assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state <code>creating</code>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Returns with the description of the created file system.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Otherwise, this operation returns a <code>FileSystemAlreadyExists</code>
 * error with the ID of the existing file system.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation
 * token.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * The idempotent operation allows you to retry a <code>CreateFileSystem</code>
 * call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an
 * initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file
 * system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level
 * timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same
 * creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system,
 * the client can learn of its existence from the
 * <code>FileSystemAlreadyExists</code> error.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * The <code>CreateFileSystem</code> call returns while the file system's
 * lifecycle state is still <code>creating</code>. You can check the file system
 * creation status by calling the <a>DescribeFileSystems</a> operation, which
 * among other things returns the file system state.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * This operation also takes an optional <code>PerformanceMode</code> parameter
 * that you choose for your file system. We recommend
 * <code>generalPurpose</code> performance mode for most file systems. File
 * systems using the <code>maxIO</code> performance mode can scale to higher
 * levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of
 * slightly higher latencies for most file operations. The performance mode
 * can't be changed after the file system has been created. For more
 * information, see <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html"
 * >Amazon EFS: Performance Modes</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state
 * to <code>available</code>, at which point you can create one or more mount
 * targets for the file system in your VPC. For more information, see
 * <a>CreateMountTarget</a>. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2
 * instances in your VPC by using the mount target. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html">Amazon
 * EFS: How it Works</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This operation requires permissions for the
 * <code>elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem</code> action.
