 * <p>Modifies many of the details of the specified secret. If you include a <code>ClientRequestToken</code> and <i>either</i> <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> then it also creates a new version attached to the secret.</p> <p>To modify the rotation configuration of a secret, use <a>RotateSecret</a> instead.</p> <note> <p>The Secrets Manager console uses only the <code>SecretString</code> parameter and therefore limits you to encrypting and storing only a text string. To encrypt and store binary data as part of the version of a secret, you must use either the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.</p> </note> <ul> <li> <p>If a version with a <code>VersionId</code> with the same value as the <code>ClientRequestToken</code> parameter already exists, the operation results in an error. You cannot modify an existing version, you can only create a new version.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you include <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> to create a new secret version, Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to the new version. </p> </li> </ul> <note> <ul> <li> <p>If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a AWS KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default AWS managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same AWS account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in AWS creating the account's AWS-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the secret resides in a different AWS account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom AWS KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different AWS account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the <code>KMSKeyId</code>. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> using credentials from a different account then the AWS KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p> <b>Minimum permissions</b> </p> <p>To run this command, you must have the following permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>secretsmanager:UpdateSecret</p> </li> <li> <p>kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a custom AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account's AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager.</p> </li> <li> <p>kms:Decrypt - needed only if you use a custom AWS KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account's AWS managed CMK for Secrets Manager.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Related operations</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>To create a new secret, use <a>CreateSecret</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To add only a new version to an existing secret, use <a>PutSecretValue</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To get the details for a secret, use <a>DescribeSecret</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To list the versions contained in a secret, use <a>ListSecretVersionIds</a>.</p> </li> </ul>
