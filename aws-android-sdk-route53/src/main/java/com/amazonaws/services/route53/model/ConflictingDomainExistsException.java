/**
 * <p>
 * The cause of this error depends on the operation that you're performing:

 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Create a public hosted zone:</b> Two hosted zones that have the same name
 * or that have a parent/child relationship (example.com and test.example.com)
 * can't have any common name servers. You tried to create a hosted zone that
 * has the same name as an existing hosted zone or that's the parent or child of
 * an existing hosted zone, and you specified a delegation set that shares one
 * or more name servers with the existing hosted zone. For more information, see
 * <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReusableDelegationSet.html"

 * already exists and is already associated with the Amazon VPC that you
 * specified.
